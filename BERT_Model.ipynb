      "Text: Comments on Issue  Record Issues in Scope Circumvention and Covered Merchandise Inquiries for Companion AD and CVD OrdersWe note that there are still some ambiguities in Commerces practice that have caused distress and inconvenience to stakeholders and are not fully addressed by Commerces proposed rule For example while Commerce has launched a large number of anticircumvention

Lastly the retrospective effect of scope clarification requires further clarificationComments on Issue  Procedures for Commerce To Place Previous Analysis and Calculation Memoranda From Other Segments

suggested modification to Article Comments on Issue  Proposed Codification of the Practice on Hierarchy of Adverse Facts Available In evaluating this part of Commerces proposed rule it is vital to consider that WTO rules do not authorize members to apply Adverse Facts Available hereinafter AFA when calculating countervailing duty rates However Commerces proposed addition of Section g explicitly requires the DOC to select the highest calculated rate for the samesimilar program when choosing AFA rates which carries an apparent punitive nature and is not in line with the ASCM Meanwhile the US Court of International Trade has taken a negative stance toward the DOCs abuse of AFA determinations The Court has set high standards and strict precedents for the application of AFA to restrain its punitive nature However Commerces proposed revision of Section g applies the highest rate under several circumstances which further reinforces the punitive nature of AFA and thus contradicts the legal principles demonstrated by the US Court of International Trade in its decisions We urge Commerce to ensure the application of AFA in a manner consistent with the WTO agreements and US court holdingsComments on Issue  Regulation for Determining the Existence of a Particular Market Situation PMSThe proposed PMS rules are in violation of the spirit of the WTO Antidumping Agreement and

Enforcement of Trade Remedies Through the Administration of the Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Laws Written Comments of China Chamber of International Commerce  July      July    Submitted via Regulationsgov The Honorable Lisa W Wang Assistant Secretary for Enforcement and Compliance International Trade Administration Room  US Department of Commerce  Constitution Ave Avenue NW Washington DC   Re Comments on Regulations Improving and Strengthening the Enforcement of Trade Remedies Through the Administration of the Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Laws Docket No ITA Dear Assistant Secretary Wang These comments are timely filed by China Chamber of International Commerce CCOIC on the US Department of Commerces proposed changes to antidumping duty AD and countervailing duty CVD laws CCOIC submits these comments in order that Commerce might futher refine and solidify its enforcement of trade remedies through AD and CVD regulations I Introduction Established in  CCOIC is a national chamber of commerce consisting of enterprises associations and other organizations which engage international commercial activities in China The main responsibilities of CCOIC include promoting international economic and trade cooperation expressing interests and concerns of Chinese business stakeholders to international organizations China and foreign countries participating in constitution and promotion of international trade rules; and advocating social responsibility and normative practices among its members. By the end of December 2022, the CCOIC’s total membership stood at 351,000, including two types, direct and indirect members. According to the requirements of the Articles of Association of the China Chamber of International Commerce and the Membership Management Measures of the China Chamber of International Commerce, the total number of direct members who have applied for membership is 1,933, including council members and ordinary member. Among CCOIC’s direct members, 128 companies are Fortune Global 500 and 253 companies are -2-  China's top 500. Direct members pay annual membership fees to the CCOIC, and the latter provides services directly to the former. In addition, there are many enterprises that join CCOIC as group members and enjoy membership services as indirect members through organizations such as industry and business associations. In recent years, the governance structure of CCOIC has been further optimized, and industrial representativeness has been further enhanced.  II. Comments on Issue 7: Record Issues in Scope, Circumvention, and Covered Merchandise Inquiries for Companion AD and CVD Orders We note that Commerce has proposed to make further refinements to some of its investigation procedures, making it clear that in a scope ruling or anti-circumvention inquiry against a product covered by both AD and CVD orders, all subsequent investigation documents will be uploaded to the anti-dumping case information after the case is filed. The APO documents in the records can also be cross-referenced in the anti-dumping and countervailing procedures. Commerce states that this amendment further clarifies the specific details of the uploading of case documents, and removes the barriers related to the APO system in this regard, which will to a certain extent reduce the procedural burden on the participants of the case. However, we note that there are still some ambiguities in Commerce's practice that have caused distress and inconvenience to stakeholders and are not fully addressed by Commerce’s proposed rule. For example, while Commerce has launched a large number of anti-circumvention inquiries, it has not adequately published the initiation or determination announcements of the cases, as it has done so on the Dumping and Subsidy Notification website. We have searched all the announcements of anti-circumvention inquiries initiated by Commerce since the ACCESS was introduced in 2011. A comparison with announcements like the initiation memos published in the Federal Register shows that the ACCESS records are incomplete. We hope that Commerce will take note of this aspect so that relevant stakeholders can more easily search for anti-circumvention cases in order to protect their rights and interests.  III. Comments on Issue 8: Examples of Proposed Rules for Scope Clarification at Any Stage We note that Commerce has recently provided additional clarification regarding its authority to conduct scope clarification at any stage. Moreover, Commerce has furnished various examples of circumstances where such scope clarification may take place. From the perspective of exporter, this revision significantly expands the jurisdiction of Commerce in defining the scope of anti-dumping and countervailing duty, thereby intensifying uncertainty and compliance risks. Consequently, it is imperative that Commerce provide further clarification on the application boundaries of scope clarifications and scope rulings, while ensuring a fair opportunity for both the petitioner and respondents to comment and rebut. Specifically, we identify several issues within this revision that necessitate careful consideration by Commerce. Firstly, there is ambiguity surrounding the application boundaries of “scope clarifications” and “scope rulings.” The proposed revision broadens the -3-  range of applicability and scenarios for scope clarification without clearly delineating its limitations. As a result, Commerce may subjectively expand the use of scope clarifications, arbitrarily determining matters pertaining to the scope of orders that should have been thoroughly examined through the scope ruling procedures. This creates an unfair situation for exporters. Secondly, the proposed revision detrimentally impacts the compliance operations of exporters. The heightened flexibility and comprehensiveness of scope clarifications amplify the challenges faced by exporters in adhering to US anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders. An anti-dumping or countervailing duty order’s scope, which has already been established in the published Orders, can be modified at any time by Commerce through interpretive footnotes, memoranda, or Federal Register notices. The absence of clear criteria and fixed standards makes it arduous for exporters to determine whether their products fall within the scope of US anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders, thus increasing compliance risks and the likelihood of legal disputes. Thirdly, there is a lack of opportunity for the petitioners and respondents to provide comments and counterarguments. The proposed revision expands the time, scope, and format of scope clarifications employed by Commerce, thereby augmenting its authority. However, it fails to offer the petitioner and respondent a chance to present corresponding comments or counter the provided clarification. Once Commerce issues interpretive footnotes, memoranda, or Federal Register notices, the petitioner and respondent are only able to accept them passively, which unfairly disadvantages both parties. Lastly, the retrospective effect of scope clarification requires further clarification. If a scope clarification essentially broadens the product scope affected by anti-dumping and countervailing duties, such measures should not be retroactively applied to imported products. In conclusion, this revision must ensure that the utilization of scope clarification procedure adheres to the principles of fairness, transparency, and predictability in order to achieve the objectives of fair trade and mutually beneficial outcomes.  IV. Comments on Issue 10: Procedures for Commerce To Place Previous Analysis and Calculation Memoranda From Other Segments or Proceedings on the Record After Written Arguments Have Been Submitted But Before the Final Determination or Results Has Been Issued We note that this modification aims to address the issue faced by the Commerce in the final stages of certain procedures, namely the prohibition on all interested parties from submitting new factual information to refute, clarify, or correct the newly submitted factual information by Commerce. Overall, Commerce holds significant power in trade remedy inquiries, as it has the authority to incorporate new factual information into the procedural record at any time. It also possesses considerable autonomy in formulating, modifying, and updating procedural processes. While this amendment may seem to treat petitioners and respondents equally, the focus should not solely revolve around the balance of these two parties’ power. It should also consider whether the -4-  investigating authority, i.e., the Commerce, is leveraging this amendment to reduce its burdens or expand its own powers under the pretext of \"reducing burdens\". We strongly believe that the proposed amendment to Article 10 expands the authority of the Commerce, which is fundamentally unfair to both petitioners and respondents. Therefore, we oppose the suggested modification to Article 10.  V. Comments on Issue 12: Proposed Codification of the Practice on Hierarchy of “Adverse Facts Available” In evaluating this part of Commerce’s proposed rule, it is vital to consider that WTO rules do not authorize members to apply Adverse Facts Available (hereinafter “AFA”) when calculating countervailing duty rates. While Article 12.7 of the ASCM allows members to make determinations based on facts available when they are not able to obtain necessary information, it does not allow the imposition of punitive measures when necessary information cannot be obtained. Article 12.7 states that in the course of a countervailing duty investigation, if respondents cannot provide evidence, the importing country's investigating authority may make determinations based on the information available. This information is commonly referred to as \"facts available.\" However, the WTO rules do not authorize members to apply adverse facts available in calculating countervailing duty rates, and WTO jurisprudence has further ruled on the illegality of applying adverse facts available: In US - Pipes and Tubes (Turkey), the Panel concluded that invoking Article 12.7 of the ASCM was intended to substitute for missing necessary information in DOC's investigations, allowing the investigating authority to make accurate countervailing duty determinations, rather than punishing the uncooperative party through deliberate adverse inferences. Using inferences to select adverse facts to penalize non-cooperating parties would result in inaccurate subsidy determinations.1 In US - Supercalendered Paper, the Appellate Body noted that the DOC's refusal to take further steps to confirm the nature of the information found, based on inconvenience or impracticality, cannot serve as a justification for evading the legitimate rights established under WTO agreements. Therefore, the Appellate Body agreed with the Panel that the DOC cannot conclude without further analysis and consideration of the facts available in the case and the legitimate rights of the interested parties. 2 The provisions and rulings mentioned above demonstrate that the legislative purpose of ASCM Article 12.7 does not include the intention to punish non-cooperating parties through the deliberate use of adverse inferences. However, Commerce’s proposed addition of Section 351.308(g) explicitly requires the DOC to select the highest calculated rate for the same/similar  Panel Report, US — Pipes and Tubes (Turkey), part. 7.5.5. (“Conclusions regarding Turkey's Article 12.7 claims”). 1  2 Appellate Body Report, US – Supercalendered Paper, paras. 5.81-5.82. -5-  program when choosing AFA rates, which carries an apparent punitive nature and is not in line with the ASCM. Furthermore, it is clear that Section 351.308(g) does not align with the spirit of US court rulings regarding AFA determinations. In existing practice, the United States Court of International Trade has repeatedly rejected DOC’s application of AFA, restricting the preconditions for DOC to apply AFA, requiring DOC to fully and clearly communicate the information it requires to provide when applying AFA, and avoiding adverse effects on cooperating parties. This also proves that the US Court of International Trade intends to limit the punitive implications of AFA application. In Peer Bearing Co.-Changshan v. United States, the US Court of International Trade noted that “fairness requires that Commerce, before invoking an adverse inference, must have communicated its information requests clearly and adequately”.3 Furthermore, in Guizhou Tyre v. United States, the Court highlighted that “What Commerce labels a ‘failure to cooperate’ is actually a failure by Commerce to request the proper information… If there is any gap in the record at all, the missing information could have resulted only from Commerce’s poorly-tailored fact-finding”4, and “[t]o apply AFA in circumstances where relevant information exists elsewhere on the record - that is, solely to deter non-cooperation or ‘simply to punish’- would make the agency’s determination based on an incomplete (and therefore, inaccurate) account of the record, that is a fate this court should sidestep.”5 Based on the above rulings, it is evident that the US Court of International Trade has taken a negative stance toward the DOC’s abuse of AFA determinations. The Court has set high standards and strict precedents for the application of AFA, to restrain its punitive nature. However, Commerce’s proposed revision of Section 351.308(g) applies the highest rate under several circumstances, which further reinforces the punitive nature of AFA, and thus contradicts the legal principles demonstrated by the US Court of International Trade in its decisions. In light of the obligation for compliance with WTO rules and with consistent US domestic court precedents, we urge Commerce to ensure the application of AFA in a manner consistent with the WTO agreements and US court holdings.  VI. Comments on Issue 14: Regulation for Determining the Existence of a Particular Market Situation (PMS) A.  General Observations 1. The Proposed PMS Rules are in Violation of the Spirit of the WTO Anti-dumping Agreement.  3  36 CIT 1115, 1130, 853 F. Supp. 2d 1365, 1377–78 (2012)  4 Guizhou Tyre II, Slip Op. 19-114 at 9-10 5 Guizhou Tyre Co., Ltd., 348 F. Supp. 3d at 1270. -6-  The purpose of the WTO Anti-dumping Agreement is to regulate the discriminatory pricing behaviors of certain companies. However, in Commerce’s proposed regulation the listed circumstances to be considered in determining sales-based PMS or cost-based PMS are primarily concerned with government policies or economic phenomenon, which are related to neither companies’ own behaviors nor any factor considered during companies’ pricing behaviors. Therefore, to introduce those circumstances as standards to determine a PMS is in violation of original intention of the WTO Anti-dumping Agreement. Meanwhile, the provisions of cost-based PMS in the proposed regulation also exceeds the limit of the PMS concept in the WTO Anti-dumping Agreement, and is inconsistent with WTO precedents. According to Article 2.2 of WTO Anti-dumping Agreement6, along with “the low volume of the sales in the domestic market of the exporting country”, a PMS is merely one of the reasons to cause sales which do not permit a proper comparison, which will then have the legal effect of requiring that “the margin of dumping shall be determined by comparison with a comparable price of the like product when exported to an appropriate third country (third country price), provided that this price is representative, or with the cost of production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount for administrative, selling and general costs and for profits (constructed price).” According to Article 2.2.1.1 of WTO Anti-dumping Agreement, unless records kept by the exporter or producer under investigation are (1) not in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the exporting country, or (2) not reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the product under consideration, costs shall be calculated on the basis of records kept by the exporter or producer under investigation.7 According to WTO Appellate Body’s determination in European Union - Anti-Dumping Measures on Biodiesel From Argentina8 and Panel’s determination in European Union - Cost Adjustment Methodologies and Certain Anti-Dumping Measures on Imports from Russia (Second Complaint)9, the second condition of Article 2.2.1.1 should not be interpreted in a way that would allow an investigating authority to reject the recorded cost information of the exporter or producer under investigation. Therefore, the PMS rules proposed by Commerce will cause significant and unwarranted unpredictability and will severely damage the authoritativeness of multilateral trade remedy rules. 2. The Proposed PMS Rules are in Violation of Nondelegation Doctrine and WTO Anti-dumping Agreement, Article 2.2 “When there are no sales of the like product in the ordinary course of trade in the domestic market of the exporting country or when, because of the particular market situation or the low volume of the sales in the domestic market of the exporting country, such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the margin of dumping shall be determined by comparison with a comparable price of the like product when exported to an appropriate third country, provided that this price is representative, or with the cost of production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount for administrative, selling and general costs and for profits.” 7 Id. Article 2.2.1.1 “For the purpose of paragraph 2, costs shall normally be calculated on the basis of records kept by the exporter or producer under investigation, provided that such records are in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the exporting country and reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the product under consideration……” 8 Report of the Appellate Body, European Union - Anti-Dumping Measures on Biodiesel from Argentina, WT/DS473/AB/R, paras 6.27 to 6.57. 9 Report of the Panel, European Union - Cost Adjustment Methodologies and Certain Anti-Dumping Measures on Imports from Russia (Second Complaint), WT/DS494/R, paras 7.239 to 7.253. 6  -7-  Overexpand Commerce’s Discretion. The proposed § 351.416 grants tremendous discretion in determining a PMS, which may be in violation of the nondelegation doctrine under the US Constitution. In limiting Congress’s power to delegate, the nondelegation doctrine exists primarily to prevent Congress from ceding its legislative power to other entities (including administrative agencies or to private organizations) not vested with legislative authority under the Constitution.10 As the primary means to enforce the nondelegation doctrine, the Supreme Court has required that Congress lay out an “intelligible principle” to govern and guide its delegee.11 As an important standard established in the jurisprudence on the constitutionality of congressional delegation of authority, an “intelligible principle” requires that Congress delineate a legal framework to limit the executive branch’s exercise of discretion that without permissible delegation of authority, no branches of government is allowed to make decision with high importance. In addition, we also note that, the most recent judgment made by the US court emphasizes that the administrative agencies of the United States should not go beyond the authority delegated by the laws and willfully expand their powers by continuous self-empowerment.12 In these proposed regulations, numerous instances of ambiguous language are found (e.g. “likely”), and numerous arbitrary delegative provisions are established. For example, the proposed paragraph (g) of §351.416 provides 12 examples of potential particular market situations without legal basis, in which once the circumstances described in those examples are likely to contribute to cost distortions of the subject merchandise or distortions in the price or cost of certain input, such circumstances can be directly determined as a PMS. Those delegative provisions may violate the nondelegation doctrine, and furthermore they are inconsistent with the traditional legislative spirit of the United States, they overexpand the discretion of Commerce, and they distort the original purpose of trade remedies. This in turn causes the US trade remedies to be an instrument of pure trade protection and may eventually harm the well-being of people in the United States. 3. Subsidy Issues Are Not Permitted to be Addressed by Anti-dumping Measures. Commerce should not repeatedly determine an issue subject to the countervailing duty laws in an anti-dumping investigation, otherwise this will cause an unlawful double remedy. In the written submission of the European Commission to the Panel in Certain Prepared or Preserved Tomatoes Exported to Australia from the Republic of Italy by Ar Industrie Alimentari S.P.A, the European Commission argues that according to Article 32.1 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement) ‘no specific action against a subsidy of another Member can be taken except in accordance with the provisions of GATT 1994, as interpreted by this Agreement’. Constitution Annotated, ArtI.S1.5.1 Overview of Nondelegation Doctrine.  11 Constitution Annotated, ArtI.S1.5.3 Origin of Intelligible Principle Standard.  12 See Jilin Forest Industry Jinqiao Flooring Group Co. Ltd. v. United States, Slip Op. 23-14, Court No. 18-00191 (CIT February 9, 2023) at 33, 34, 36. 10  -8-  In other words, a subsidy should not be addressed in the framework of an anti-dumping investigation, in particular in the absence of a positive conclusion on the existence of a particular market situation (see below). It is indeed clear from their separate existence that anti-dumping and countervailing measures are two instruments that reflect a different rationale and address situations of a different nature: on the one hand, market distorting effects by government subsidies, on the other hand, company-driven economic practices.13 Also, in the Panel Report of European Union - Anti-Dumping Measures on Biodiesel from Argentina, the Panel notes that the concept of “dumping” is not intended to cover any distortion arising out of government action or circumstances.14 Therefore, according to the aforementioned WTO agreements and WTO precedents, Commerce should not address a subsidy issue by using anti-dumping measures. If the investigating authority intends to investigate certain circumstances of government intervention, it should initiate an independent countervailing duty investigation in accordance with the WTO’s legal framework, rather than repeatedly including this in an anti-dumping procedure. B. Comments on Specific Provisions 1. A “Proper Comparison” Standard should be Applied. The proposed PMS regulations do not request that a “proper comparison” must be applied when a cost-based PMS is being determined. It is only mentioned in the proposed paragraph (h) of §351.416 that “the Secretary may consider whether this particular market situation contributes to the circumstance or set of circumstances that prevent, or do not permit, a proper comparison of home market or third country sales prices with export prices or constructed export prices, in accordance with section 771(15) of the Act.” We would like to stress that, in accordance with WTO agreements and the domestic laws of the US, a “proper comparison” standard must be applied when Commerce has intent to determine a cost-based PMS; otherwise it shall not determine a PMS and therefore exclude the price of like products in domestic market of exporting country as the normal value during calculation of dumping margin. Commerce should explicitly state this “proper comparison” standard in its formal regulation. According to Article 2.2 of WTO Anti-dumping Agreement, a PMS is merely one of the reasons that may cause sales not to permit a proper comparison; in other words, only when a PMS causes the result that do not permit a proper comparison between export price of subject products and price of like products in domestic market of exporting country, a third country price or a constructed price may be applied in calculation of dumping margin. Otherwise, the investigating Written submission of the European Commission to the Anti-Dumping Review Panel, Certain Prepared or Preserved Tomatoes Exported to Australia from The Republic of Italy by AR Industrie Alimentari S.P.A (ADN 2017/46), at 10. 14 Report of the Panel, European Union - Anti-Dumping Measures on Biodiesel from Argentina WT/DS473/R, para 7.240. 13  -9-  authority should still apply the price of like products in domestic market of exporting country as normal value. In Australia-Anti-Dumping Measures on A4 Copy Paper, the Panel equates the analyses of “ordinary course of trade” and “permit a proper comparison”, while the Australian Anti-Dumping Commission (ADC) focused on whether government's involvement resulted in a distortion of the domestic price but failed to give meaning and effect to the phrase “permit a proper comparison”, which is therefore inconsistent with Article 2.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.15 The domestic laws of the United States also adopt a similar logic. Section 771(15) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), provides that “……The administering authority shall consider the following sales and transactions, among others, to be outside the ordinary course of trade: ……(C) Situations in which the administering authority determines that the particular market situation prevents a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price.” That is to say, if the accused PMS does not prevent a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price, even an existence of PMS per se cannot be excluded from the ordinary course of trade. Also in accordance with Section 773(a)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, unless in the case to which subparagraph (C) applies, the normal value of the subject merchandise shall be the price “at which the foreign like product is first sold (or, in the absence of a sale, offered for sale) for consumption in the exporting country, in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade and, to the extent practicable, at the same level of trade as the export price or constructed export price”. Therefore, if the investigating authority does not determine whether a PMS prevents a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price, it should not directly determine such PMS to be outside the “ordinary course of trade” and therefore exclude use of price of like products in domestic market of exporting country in dumping margin calculation. According to the aforementioned WTO agreements and precedents and US laws, a “proper comparison” standard must constitute a precondition of determining a PMS; otherwise the price of like products in the domestic market of the exporting country must not be directly excluded without conducting a “proper comparison” analysis. Accordingly, we urge Commerce to change its expression in the proposed paragraph (h) of §351.416 that “the Secretary may consider……” to “the Secretary shall consider……”, in conformity with the WTO statutes and domestic laws of the United States. 2. A More Rigorous Standard Should Be Applied in Determining a PMS and a “Cause and Effect” Analysis Must Be Conducted. In NEXTEEL Co. v. United States (NEXTEEL), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) held that Commerce must find that the cost incurred to produce the subject merchandise “does not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade.”16 In addition, the CAFC also held that the existence of a circumstance or set of circumstance per se does not constitute substantial evidence for the finding of a PMS. For example, for Commerce’s finding of a PMS on the ground of the subsidies provided by Korean government 15 16  Report of the Panel, Australia-Anti-Dumping Measures on A4 Copy Paper, WT/DS529/R, para. 7.87 to 7.90. See NEXTEEL Co. v. United States, 28 F.4th 1226 (Fed. Cir. 2022) ( NEXTEEL). - 10 -  to the input hot-rolled coil (HRC) of oil country tubular goods (OCTG), the CAFC found that “subsidies must be shown to affect the price of the input so that it does ‘not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade’,” and “Commerce made no finding that any subsidies were passed through to the prices of HRC”, “thus, substantial evidence does not support Commerce’s finding that Korean HRC subsidies contribute to a particular market situation.”17 For another example, for Commerce’s finding of a PMS on the ground of strategic alliances, the CAFC found that “Commerce merely speculated that strategic alliances affected the Korean HRC market as a whole”, and “its showing of some relationship between POSCO (HRC supplier) and SeAH (OCTG producer) is weak and contradicted by other record evidence”, and “substantial evidence does not support Commerce’s finding that strategic alliances contribute to a particular market situation”.18 In Commerce’s proposed paragraph (d)(1), the 12 examples provided in proposed paragraph (g), and any other relevant provisions, Commerce only requires that the circumstances are “likely to contribute to” the fact that those prices or costs are not in accordance with market-based principles or are distorted. We believe that this standard is too loose and far below the proof standard required by the CAFC. As required by the CAFC in the above cases, Commerce must conduct an analysis that “subsidies were passed through to the prices of HRC”, and thus there must be an explicit cause and effect between the accused circumstances and the distortion. Although a PMS may enable the producers of subject merchandise or a significant input (or inputs) used in the production of the subject merchandise to gain an unfair competitive advantage in the market, it does not mean a causation of impact to the market price of the subject merchandise as a matter of course. We urge Commerce to modify the expression of relevant provisions to change “likely” to the appropriate wording, so as to conform to the CAFC’s standard of proof that Commerce “must” find that the cost incurred to produce the subject merchandise “does not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade.” 3. The Standard of “Particular” in Determining a Cost-based PMS Mandated by the CAFC must be Followed. In NEXTEEL, the CAFC agreed and repeatedly reiterated that the circumstances supporting a PMS and their effect must be “particular” to producers of the subject merchandise.19 However, Commerce’s proposed paragraph (e)(1) of proposed §351.416 (e) goes beyond the meaning of the word “particular” itself. The new proposed regulation provides that the determination of “particular” can be reached even if (i) a large number of distinct products or parties are impacted, (ii) the same or similar market situations can exist in multiple countries or markets, or (iii) there are varied circumstances in which a market situation in a subject country, including a market situation that distorts the cost of production for certain products or for certain importers, producers, exporters, purchasers, users, enterprises, or industries, individually or in combination with other entities. The above provisions not only deviate from the meaning of the “particular” itself, but also 17 18 19  Id, at 1237-1238. Id, at 1238-1239. Id, at 1234 and 1237. - 11 -  expand the original meaning of the CAFC determination without clear limitation. According to the requirements of the CAFC, the circumstances supporting a “particular” market situation also must be “particular” to producers of the subject merchandise.20 Therefore, the “particular” standard should be strictly limited to the relevant factors in connection with the production of the subject merchandise, for example, it must be limited only to the country where a producer of the subject merchandise is located, or the industry where subject merchandise or a significant input to the production of subject merchandise belongs to. It should not be expanded, without limitation, to countries, industries, or enterprises that have no relationship with subject merchandise itself and producers and productions of subject merchandise, or to various entities that are not producers of the subject merchandise or are not related to the production of the subject merchandise by such producers, such as importers, exporters, purchasers, users, etc. By expanding the scope of “particular” standard, the original meaning of “particular” is distorted and cannot serve as a constraint at all. This generalized interpretation contradicts the precedent of the CAFC. We urge Commerce to revise this proposed regulation to comply with the CAFC precedents. 4. The Types of Information and Associated Arguments Listed in Paragraph (d)(3) of Proposed § 351.416 Should Not Be Excluded from Consideration. In paragraph (d)(3) of proposed § 351.416, Commerce lists four types of information and associated arguments that it will not be required to consider in every cost-based PMS analysis, including the speculative costs or prices, actions taken or not taken by governments, state enterprises, or other public entities in other market economy countries in comparison with the actions taken or not taken by the government of the subject country, and references to historical policies and previous actions taken by the government of the subject country with respect to the subject merchandise or a significant input into the production. The exclusion of those information and associated arguments by Commerce would severely and unfairly undermine due process rights of the respondent, because the restriction on the above information and associated arguments precludes the respondent from employing effective means to prove that the subject country is not taking market-distorting actions. In respect of the important due process right, Commerce should allow interested parties to submit all evidence that can support their views, claims and arguments on the record, so that the parties can fully present their opinions. Regardless of whether those views or evidence can eventually be adopted by the investigating authority during the procedure, the rights of parties to fully present their views and evidence should be fully respected. Even if Commerce itself does not consider such information, Commerce shall not refuse to accept such information on the record, otherwise the important due process rights of interested parties will be deprived, and interested parties will also lose the opportunity to present such information and associated arguments to the court in the subsequent appeal procedure, resulting in great procedural unfairness. 5. Twelve Examples Listed in Proposed Paragraph (g) of Proposed § 351.416 Are In Violation of Domestic Laws of the United States With respect to the 12 examples listed in proposed paragraph (g) of §351.416, we express the 20  Id, at 1234 and 1237. - 12 -  following concerns: Firstly, the ambiguous wording “likely contribute to distortion” are used in majority of the examples listed in the proposed paragraph (g) as a standard to determine a PMS. Such ambiguous expression and arbitrary speculation create substantial uncertainty and unlawfully overexpand Commerce’s discretion, which may be in violation of the nondelegation doctrine under the US Constitution. In limiting Congress’s power to delegate, the nondelegation doctrine exists primarily to prevent Congress from ceding its legislative power to other entities (including administrative agencies or to private organizations) not vested with legislative authority under the Constitution.21 As the primary means to enforce the nondelegation doctrine, the Supreme Court has required that Congress lay out an intelligible principle to govern and guide its delegee.22 As an important standard “intelligible principle” established in the jurisprudence on the constitutionality of congressional delegation of authority, an “intelligible principle” requires that Congress delineate a legal framework to limit the executive branch’s exercise of discretion that without permissible delegation of authority, no branches of government is allowed to make decision with high importance. In addition, we also note that, the most recent judgment by the US court emphasizes that the administrative agencies of the United States should not go beyond the authority delegated by the laws and willfully expand their powers by continuous self-empowerment.23 Secondly, Commerce’s ambiguous concluding of those 12 examples as “particular market situations that may not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade” is not in conformity with the definition of “ordinary course of trade” under the domestic law of the US. Under the applicable US statute, “ordinary course of trade” is defined as “the conditions and practices which, for a reasonable time prior to the exportation of the subject merchandise, have been normal in the trade under consideration with respect to merchandise of the same class or kind.”24 However, the reason why those 12 examples do not belong to the ordinary course of trade is not reflected in the proposed regulation. The circumstances enumerated in those examples are not factors to be considered during companies’ pricing behaviors. In consideration of cost of production in the ordinary course of trade, Commerce should not expand to encompass factors that exceed companies’ normal business conduct. Commerce’s proposed 12 examples fabricates a new legal framework different from existing US anti-dumping laws. Such practice has no authority under US domestic laws. The circumstances to constitutes a PMS should be analyzed based on facts and conditions presented in case-by-case basis. Commerce should not make hypotheses in advance in any regulations that existence of certain circumstance or set of circumstances directly constitutes PMS, where it has no warrant to do so. Such practice of Commerce has been rejected by the CAFC.25 Thirdly, regarding examples pertaining to issues of property, intellectual property, human Constitution Annotated, ArtI.S1.5.1 Overview of Nondelegation Doctrine.  22 Constitution Annotated, ArtI.S1.5.3 Origin of Intelligible Principle Standard.  23 See Jilin Forest Industry Jinqiao Flooring Group Co. Ltd. v. United States, Slip Op. 23-14, Court No. 18-00191 (CIT February 9, 2023) at 33, 34, 36. 24 Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, Sec 771 (15) 25 See NEXTEEL, 28 F.4th at 1237 to 1239. 21  - 13 -  rights, labor, or environmental protections, those issues are not within the jurisdiction of any trade remedies under the WTO, but are otherwise governed by other international treaties, and there are other corresponding departments of the United States in charge of those issues. The WTO legal framework has no remedy measures to regulate the above-mentioned issues of property, intellectual property, human rights, labor, or environmental protection. Therefore, such issues cannot be resolved by trade remedy measures under the WTO, otherwise the authoritativeness of multilateral rules will be severely undermined. Commerce should not overstep the functions and authorities of other departments and attempt to administrate matters which should be under the jurisdiction of other departments in the trade remedy procedure, which is contrary to WTO rules and US domestic laws. The anti-dumping regime of the United States must comply with its multilateral obligations under the WTO and should not introduce any factors irrelevant to the existing WTO anti-dumping cost determination rules into its anti-dumping regulations. 6. The Consequence of Determining a Cost-Based PMS Is Unclear, And Will Improperly Expand Commerce’s Discretion. According to Article 2.2 of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement, along with “the low volume of the sales in the domestic market of the exporting country”, a PMS is merely one of the reasons to cause sales not to permit a proper comparison. The existence of PMS per se is not punitive, and its legal effect is only to apply “third country prices” or “constructed prices”, rather than the “use any reasonable methodology to determine an appropriate adjustment to its calculations” provided in the proposed new regulation. For example, in the first Administrative Review of Certain Oil Country Tubular Goods from the Republic of Korea, Commerce determined to make an upward adjustment to NEXTEEL’s and SeAH’s reported costs for HRC based on the subsidy rates determined in the CVD investigation of Hot-Rolled Steel Flat Products from Korea.26 Commerce subjectively ordered substantial increases in the anti-dumping margin by using this method. In addition, the provision of “use any reasonable methodology to determine an appropriate adjustment to its calculations” lacks stability and predictability. Since there is no clear standard of use, there will remain a very broad range for manipulation of Commerce’s practice, which will certainly result in the abuse of discretion and unfair results to the respondent. We urge Commerce to eliminate this proposed provision to avoid the abuse of rules and damage to the legitimate rights and interests of interested parties.  VII. Comments on Issue 21: Calculation of Ad Valorem Subsidy Rate and Attribution of Subsidy to a Product Commerce proposes the insertion of the word “normally” into both paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of § 351.525, such that the language used in both paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of § 351.525 will be changed from “the Secretary will” to “the Secretary will normally.” CCOIC believes that the proposed modification should not be adopted because it creates unpredictability and excessive discretion brought by ambiguity. As stated in the Proposed Rule, the purpose of the insertion of the word “normally” into both paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of § 351.525 would ensure that there is no See Certain Oil Country Tubular Goods from the Republic of Korea: Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; 2014-2015, 82 FR 18105 (April 17, 2017), and accompanying Issues & Decision Memorandum at 42. 26  - 14 -  perceived conflict with the language in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) and the language in § 351.525(b)(7) that allows Commerce to attribute a subsidy to multinational production under extremely limited circumstances. The description in the Explanation of the Proposed Rule is so vague that it lacks solid and reasonable explanations regarding the necessity of amending this paragraph of the rules. As indicated in the Proposed Rule, the proposed modification by adding the word “normally” seems to aim at a situation in the future where Commerce may encounter “a unique type of subsidy program” that warrants an allocation of an export or domestic subsidy in a manner that is otherwise not contemplated by the language of existing (b)(2) and (3) of § 351.525. The use of the word “normally”, implies that there could be circumstances that the subsidies specified by law do not cover any future potential circumstances of government intervention which have not been regulated by current law, and the insertion of the word “normally” would allow Commerce to make an allocation of a subsidy which is not regulated by law. CCOIC believes that, without clear and specific definition of “extremely limited circumstances” other than “normal circumstances”, the proposed modification by adding the word “normally” into both paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of § 351.525 does not achieve the objective of predictability and enforceability of the law; rather, it would create unpredictability and unduly expend the discretion of Commerce if applied. If Commerce is still considering to make the minor change to the language within paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of § 351.525, Commerce should clarify under what kind of “extremely limited circumstances” by a certain manner, such as through “exception for”, to address not only the actual needs of the investigation authority, but also increase the certainty and predictability of the law. In conclusion, CCOIC believes that the proposed modification by adding the word “normally” into both paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of § 351.525 is ambiguous and introduces an unwarranted element of subjectivity and discretion. Therefore, we oppose this proposed change.  Respectfully submitted, Xiao Sun  - 15 -      China Chamber of International Commerce\n",

on Implementation of the US Government National Standards Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technology USG NSSCET     The American Petroleum Institute API submits the following feedback to the National Institute of Standards and Technology in response to the Request for Information RFI on Implementation of the US Government National Standards Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technology USG NSSCET API is the US national trade association representing all facets of the natural gas and oil industry including low carbon initiatives In addition API is the global leader in convening subject matter experts across segments to develop maintain and distribute consensus standards and safety programs for the natural gas and oil industry APIs goal is to enhance operational safety environmental protection and sustainability across the industry especially through the global adoption of standards API develops standards that align with key areas in the NSSCET namely low carbon technology carbon capture utilization and storage CCUS lowcarbon hydrogen cybersecurity and additive manufacturing D printing API presents the following responses to the questions below regarding the implementation of NSSCET Question Responses  Are there potential benefits opportunities or risks associated with increased US participation in standards development activities for CET US standards development in the areas covered by CET has immense potential benefits and opportunities including buttressing US CET industry and innovation increased market access for US businesses in these rapidly developing areas and strengthening human and environmental safety US involvement allows our top experts to memorialize their experience and expertise in these emerging technology standards that establish a framework for safety efficiency and interoperability Without US involvement CET standards would be incongruous with US industry best practices thus fragmenting manufacturing operations and security in these fields Moreover standards development drives innovation notably performancebased standards API employs a performancebased approach to standards development requiring or recommending desired outcomes to ensure operational efficiency and safety rather than being overly prescriptive in all aspects of the standardized equipment and process This performancebased approach allows standards users to be innovative with their processes and technology by allowing flexibly to incorporate technological changes and new approaches while establishing basic safety and functional requirements that are critical for human and environmental safety and operational integrity This approach lays the foundation for safety and interoperability without being too strict to limit innovation for emerging technologies US involvement in standards development will improve the protection of human and environmental safety in these fields along with cybersecurity Standards allows US industry to outline safety requirements and recommendations for operations equipment and personnel which are essential as many US stakeholders rapidly enter the CET  fields In addition establishing the foundation of safety and operations aligned with US interests give domestic manufacturers a competitive advantage and facilitates market accessespecially for small and medium sized enterprises SMEs that are newer to the CET fields because they will be equipped with the basic knowledge to safely guide them instead of having to reinvent the wheel Increased participation in standardization comes with manageable risks such as potential lack of harmonization between domestic and international standards and overrepresentation of larger enterprises in the standards Many different standards developing bodiesboth USbased and internationalwill pursue standardization in CET areas so US participants need to make a concerted effort to not duplicate other activities and collaborate where possible Having multiple standards with a similar scope will create issues for standards users because requirements may vary or contradict thus complicating compliance API highly encourages USG to coordinate early and closely with SDOs and private stakeholders to assess the current existing global landscape of to identify needs and gaps in CET standardization without duplicating current work While US leadership and participation are highly beneficial in CET we should not exclude international participants from US standards development activities These technologies will be used globally over time and having USunique standards could fragment global supply chains and interoperability if they are not harmonized with global and international standards Many US companies work internationally directly or with supplies and clients so it is critical to make CET standards activities open to international stakeholders and allies API often holds workshops and roundtables coordinates with partner organizations and stakeholders and maps out current existing relevant standards to facilitate an open dialogue on the identification and need of new standards especially in emerging technology areas API has been developing and maintaining standards for over  years and API member companies drive innovation in low carbon technology areas such as carbon capture utilization and storage CCUS and lowcarbon hydrogen API has leveraged this experience and the expertise of industry to standardize these innovative low carbon technologies to safely and efficiently lower emissions Lastly standards development is voluntary can consume limited time and resources which may put SMEs and individuals at a disadvantage because they may not have the same resources as larger entities to participate The US has some larger organizations in CET areas and the implementation plan should take this into account and actively recruit SMEs and diverse stakeholders to minimize the risk of their interests being excluded  What are the potential risks or implications of decreased US participation in standards development activities for CET  Conversely the benefits detailed above would not be realized if the US decreased participation or did not take a leadership role in in CET standards activities It is imperative that the US does not decrease participation in standards development for emerging technology so it can advocate for US interests and companies drive innovation and strengthen safety and environmental protection As CET areas grow and rapidly attract more companies standards are essential to create a level playing field across economies as well as help prevent safety incidents by providing a foundational safety and interoperable framework  What are the most important challenges faced by the private sector  ie industry including startups and small and mediumsized enterprises SMEs academic community and civil society organizations when participating in standards development activities for CET and how can these challenges be addressed The most formidable challenges facing the private sector are education on the standards development process and resources These issues can be addressed by developing seminars webinars networking events and more to educate all stakeholders on the importance of CET standards the development process and how interested parties can get involved in CET activities These efforts will promote standards development and put CET experts and organizations in contact with each other The standards development process can be daunting for newcomers so USG and experienced private sector stakeholders can work together to support lessexperienced stakeholders that have the potential to enrich CET standards activities In addition standards development is voluntary and many organizations do not have the financial or time resources to contribute to standards development These can be addressed by providing financial incentivessuch as grants tax incentives discounted registration fees etcfor SMEs academia and civil society organizations to participate in the standards development process USG NSSCET Objective  Investment  How can the US Government establish policies that promote standards development for CET as a critical component of US innovation culture The US Government USG can promote publicprivate partnership in CET standards development to facilitate communication and collaboration between the sectors to help identify gaps and needs for CET standards while also underscoring the importance of standards in these fields and the role standards in innovation security and market access Close collaboration encourages dialogue technological exchange and data sharing with private sector standards developers which support the development of more robust applicable CET standards that incorporate the latest practices and technology  USG policies should also prioritize the need for standards harmonization both domestically and internationally to prevent duplication of efforts and standards In addition USG should promote private sectorled standards development participation within the government so government experts can participate in the development of CET standards and encourage the use and adoption of the standards by their agencies In addition USG should prioritize interagency coordination and collaboration on standards activities and when engaging in international forums that promote standards cooperation such as the AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation APEC. For example, when it comes to low carbon technology, agencies such as the EPA, DOC, and DOE should coordinate closely when participating in international forums to optimize USG engagement. 5. How can the U.S. Government utilize Federal spending on research and development to drive technical contributions for CET standards development activities? USG can issue funding to standards developers and research institutes in specific CET areas since new developments and technology are consistently changing. API encourages the USG to coordinate with SDOs and the private sector to identify gaps in R&D and standardization in these areas to best leverage resources. In addition, API emphasizes the importance of communication on R&D efforts and results—both interagency and public-private communication—to prevent duplication of efforts, align R&D with specific standards development goals, and efficiently incorporate new technologies and knowledge areas into new standards. 6. How can the U.S. Government facilitate the adoption of standards-based CET by industry stakeholders, including start-ups and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)? The U.S. can facilitate the adoption of standards-based CET by recommending standards through regulators, promoting standards compliant products, and disseminating education and awareness regarding standards. Regulators and government agencies can recommend standards for CET areas without mandating them. These recommendations would point enterprises in the right direction without overly regulating CET. USG can also prioritize organizations that use CET standards for government contracting, permitting approval, public procurement, and more to incentivize the use of these standards. Internationally, USG can leverage international forums and frameworks—such as APEC, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), and the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity—to include CET standards in the initiatives and agreements, host discussions and workshops on standards to increase education and  knowledge of CET standards, and promote international cooperation on and adoption of CET standards among international industry stakeholders. In addition, USG can host workshops, seminars, and more by partnering with SDOs to promote key standards and educate stakeholders, with a focus on SMEs, on key standards and the development process. Stakeholders that participate in the development of the standards are much more likely to subsequently adopt the standards and technology. 7. How can the U.S. Government better support publicly funded and private research in standards development activities for CET? As stated, USG can offer further financial support to SDOs and research entities to research different areas of CET with the intent of incorporating findings in standards. USG NSSCET Objective 2: Participation 8. How can the U.S. Government increase the amount and consistency of private sector ( i.e., industry, including start-ups and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), academic community, and civil society organizations) engagement in standards development activities for CET? USG can take a leading and coordinating role in promoting the participation of various private sector stakeholders in standards development by promoting the use of standards, educating on the importance of standards—both internally and externally of the government—and incentivizing CET standards development for the private sector through grants and/or tax incentives These efforts will help educate and motivate private sector participants and offset the cost of standards development volunteering. USG can also make a more focused effort on providing financial assistance to standards education for SMEs, academia, and civil society organizations that often have fewer resources. 9. How can the U.S. Government improve communications among the public and private sector ( i.e., industry, including start-ups and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), academic community, and civil society organizations) to address potential participation gaps in standards development activities for CET? USG can collaborate with and work through ANSI, NIST, government agencies, and SDOs to promote and advertise standards developing activities in CET. Newsletters and other push communications can be proactively sent to relevant organizations and volunteers to inform them of standards developing activities in their relevant CET area. 10. How can the U.S. Government foster early collaboration with private sector ( i.e., industry, including start-ups and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), academic community, and civil society organizations) stakeholders to  identify standards for CET that would encourage market and regulatory acceptance as needed? At what stage is early collaboration most effective? USG should begin early outreach and collaboration with the private sector at the beginning of the standards identification process to receive feedback and understand the needs of the private sector. USG can do this directly with the private sector or host workshops and forums that convene diverse stakeholders for an open dialogue. This allows all stakeholders to voice their opinion, contribute expertise, and help identify and communicate their needs. API encourages USG to collaborate with the private sector to help determine when there is a market need for a CET standard. If CET sector experts agree, then developing the standard(s) to fit the need will in turn facilitate market acceptance and encourage adoption. If a standard is needed to support regulation, then the regulatory body should communicate this need with the private sector and SDO’s early in the process for their feedback. It is prudent for USG to rely on the U.S. private sector-led standards system because it fosters diverse collaboration, save the government resources, and allows industry experts and SDOs to develop standards to fit safety and market needs while the U.S. government can still participate in the development process. 11. What roles do the academic community and civil society organizations play in standards development activities for CET, and how can they increase their contributions to a private sector-led system? The academic community provides essential expertise, research, testing, and innovation in CET technology areas and standards development process. Universities often house leading experts that conduct research and testing in innovative areas, which can be incorporated into standards. Civil society also plays an important role by advocating for consumer protection and environmental safety. This input is often highly beneficial to gain social acceptance of the standard by having more public engagement. Stakeholder mapping in CET areas then advertising new standards initiatives and actively reaching out to these groups can increase the participation of these stakeholders, so they are aware of opportunities. A publicly accessible tracker or other mapping tool for new CET standards development would facilitate this to allow all stakeholders to view opportunities to participate in CET standards development. 12. How can the U.S. Government better support state, local, and tribal governments in participating in standards development activities for CET? Involving state, local, and tribal governments in the development of CET standards will be key to harmonize standards and technical regulations domestically across different states and levels of government. The Federal government can offer training to educate state, local, and tribal governments on the importance of participating in the development process and using standards, specifically with CET. They should also be involved in early discussions and standards roadmap creation, calls for participation, and information sharing. In addition, these levels of governments often have fewer  resources, so funding via grants would be beneficial to allow them to participate in CET standards development. USG NSSCET Objective 3: Workforce 13. How can the U.S. Government leverage existing or develop new digital tools and resources that facilitate access to standards development processes, and increase engagement by private sector ( i.e., industry, including start-ups and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), academic community, and civil society organizations) CET stakeholders? USG can develop—or work with a private sector entity to develop— a single public forum and tool/database that provides an overview of CET standards development and current initiatives. USG can encourage SDOs to reach out to have any relevant initiatives included in the tool, so experts can view opportunities to participate. In addition, USG can issue a newsletter to advertise standards development, R&D, and grant opportunities to alert interested parties. API has a public standards action plan that shows all the standards under development and their processes, so interested stakeholders can view the status of the standard in real time. For educational purposes, USG can post tutorial videos or workshop/webinar recording that provide a background on CET standards and their development. Moreover, a database showing existing CET standards can help users navigate and familiarize themselves with the landscape and scope of existing and proposed CET standards to better understand which standards they can use and to prevent duplication when brainstorming new standards activities. API would like to emphasize that if such a forum or database is developed, that there is only one to prevent confusion and overlap. 14. How can the U.S. Government incentivize the modification of existing curricula and/or the creation of new curricula, to include faculty professional development, by educational institutions for pedagogy to support standards development activities for CET? USG can promote collaboration between SDOs and universities to foster education in CET areas and standards. API accomplishes this through API’s Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) initiative that provides API standards to students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority Serving Institutes to diversity our industry and build knowledge. USG can help support initiatives like this by offering grants to educational institutes and/or SDOs to work together to incorporate CET standards and their standards education in CET curricula. This will also strengthen the workforce since they will come out of their institutions with knowledge of leading standards in the CET field. Grants and additional financial support to educational institutions can also be tailored specifically to relevant faculty members to support their travel and time dedicated to standards development.  15. What standards development activities for CET can U.S. government and private sector ( i.e., industry, including start-ups and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), academic community, and civil society organizations) stakeholders promote or develop to encourage increased participation by students and trainees? USG can promote the participation of standards development by offering internships, mentorships, grants and scholarships, and CET research opportunities to students. These initiatives would allow students to work with CET professionals that participate in CET standards development and witness the process and impact first-hand. In addition, USG can partner with SDOs to help incorporate education on relevant CET standards and the development process in curricula and training programs, so students and trainees are familiar with them when they complete their relevant programs. Lastly, USG can partner with institutes and professional clubs to promote standards development among students on campuses. 16. How can the U.S. Government support both private sector and public sector recognition for standards development expertise and how can this recognition be utilized to increase standards development activities for CET? USG can recognize public sector standards development expertise through awards and career advancement and leadership opportunities for individuals and teams that contribute their expertise to standards development. For the private sector, USG can offer recognition awards and work with CET standards experts and teams as liaisons and government advisors to keep open lines of communication and recognize private expertise. USG NSSCET Objective 4: Integrity and Inclusivity 17. How can the U.S. Government work with private sector ( i.e., industry, including start-ups and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), academic community, and civil society organizations) stakeholders to more effectively coordinate with international partners and reinforce private sectorled standards development activities for CET? USG should coordinate early and closely with the private sector when engaging internationally on CET topics to identify areas where private-sector led standards can be promoted and applied to facilitate trade, market access, and technology adoption internationally. USG can do this through new or existing government programs and public-private partnerships that encourage government-private sector dialogue to assess U.S. industry’s international needs and priorities vis-à-vis standards. Standards have the ability to expand trade, drive innovation, and spur economic growth internationally by converging technical regulations, facilitating market access, emplacing requirements for human and environmental safety, and promoting the adoption of CET technology, much of which advances sustainable development. USG should incorporate  international standards, good regulatory practices (GRPs), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) principles in international agreements and partnerships, specifically with negotiations concerning CET sector. For example, Chapter 11 of the US-Mexico-Canada is dedicated to technical barriers to trade and the role of international standards, and the free trade agreement establishes mechanisms for enforcement. Incorporating these components in international agreements requires partners to adhere to international standards, GRP, and TBT principles, which foments market access, harmonized trade, and sustainability through private-sector led standardization. When negotiating agreements, USG should also have comment periods and consult with relevant CET industry stakeholders to understand priorities and potential impacts. 18. How should the U.S. Government share information on standards development activities for CET with like-minded partners and allies? USG has many international initiatives and missions through agencies, such as USAID, DOC, DOE, and more, and CET standards development can be incorporated as components of these initiatives and as a discussion topic in bilateral and multilateral dialogues. USG can look to create or expand current standards programs and publicprivate partnerships, such as the ANSI-USAID Standards Alliance, to incorporate CET standards activities and promote them abroad. USG should also promote participation in international and regional standards developing organizations, such as ISO and IEC, to increase the representation of U.S. experts in these fora and promote standards harmonization. In addition, sections related to standards, specifically with CET, should be incorporated in all trade agreements to reinforce collaboration and the World Trade Organization (WTO) Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) principles to ensure that standards do not hinder trade. For example, Chapter 11 of the US-Mexico-Canada is dedicated to technical barriers to trade and the role of international standards. All U.S. trade agreement and economic frameworks, such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) should incorporate standards development and adoption in the agreements, specifically with CET. As mentioned in a previous section on the development of digital tools, a public forum or database showing all CET standards development activities can be shared with international partners and allies, so they can track opportunities and existing standards. Voluntary consensus standards development is open to all materially affected stakeholders, and API actively recruits international participants in its standards development activities to create more robust, globally applicable standards. USG should encourage this at the international level when interacting with allies on CET topics. 19. What standards information and tools can the U.S. government develop and promote to ensure U.S. exporters can compete in global markets for CET?  USG can provide market reports and databases on CET standards that U.S. exporters must comply with to trade. A central database or reporting system would be highly beneficial, so U.S. industry can leverage it to stay abreast with current trends and standards. In addition, USG should promote and support U.S. participation in international standardization activities, which promotes the harmonization of international standards, thus reducing trade barriers and increasing market access. USG can also explore programs to help educate domestic industry on complying with major CET international standards, so they can be more competitive internationally. 20. How can the U.S. Government further advance the design and implementation of technical assistance programs for CET that enable broad and inclusive participation by developing countries in international SDOs? USG can build on current standards-focused public-private partnerships and programs, such as the ANSI-USAID Standards Alliance, and create new funding opportunities for SDOs and other entities to promote international participation in CET standards development and technological exchange. USG can also add standards components to international programs that currently do not have any standardization involved, so international partners will know which standards to utilize, receive training on them, and learn how to get involved in standards development. These funded programs can also host international and regional workshops on international standards that include prominent CET stakeholders through forums, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and Pan American Standards Commission (COPANT), and host mentors from partner countries to shadow technical experts. API currently has over 20 memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with partner organizations to promote API standards, facilitate technological exchange, educate and collaborate on low carbon technology and standards, and guide partners on joining standards development committees. API has seen success with this approach and an increase in international participants after they have been guided on the process and standards. USG programs should also have a needs assessment and benchmarking tools when engaging with developing country partners to determine their needs, improve their involvement in standardization, and track success. Standards development is a longterm commitment. However, it can pay off with the increased global adoption of CET standards and technology that are aligned with U.S. principles and industry. 21. How can the U.S. Government work with international partners to ensure that standards for CET are developed in a way that supports U.S. interests, including a commitment to free and fair market competition in which the best technologies come to market? To ensure that CET standards support U.S. interest and free and fair market competition, USG must internationally advocate for CET standards that support U.S. and allies’ national and regional interests though bilateral and multilateral agreements,  international organizations, and mutual recognition agreements. As outlined above, USG should incorporate international standards, GRPs, and WTO TBT principles into trade agreement negotiations for enforcement. USG should also have CET-specific trade missions that have standards and technical regulations as a component or main focus. Moreover, standards diplomacy and dialogue should be incorporated into any international CET engagements across agencies. The U.S. should also exclusively advocate for and promote standards that are developed in adherence to the WTO TBT principles—openness, transparency, relevance, impartiality, and consensus—to further encourage transparent, nondiscriminant trade principles. Enshrining these principles into international agreements, trade missions, and diplomacy will concurrently promote CET international standards, free market principles, and U.S. interests. Nations with a strong hegemonic influence have strategies to obligate trade and development partners to comply with their standards to give their industry a competitive advantage, such as the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative. USG should continue to recognize the importance of standards and technical regulations in geopolitical influence and trade and strategize with allies and trade partners to promote international standards that align with the national security and business interests of the United States. 22. How can the U.S. Government make the United States a more desirable location to hold international standards meetings, events, and activities for CET? API believes the United States is already a desired location for standards events, meetings, and activities. However, travel costs and visa acceptance can be hurdles for international participants. USG could make standards development activities an option for visa applications to facilitate the process for international travelers. In addition, government programs and grants could be issued to develop mentorship programs that allow international experts to travel to the U.S. and work with U.S. CET expert mentors.

      "Text: Please see the updated comments of the Government of Bangladesh as attached file    Two such offenses and their punishments are as follows Making or possessing any instrument for the purpose of counterfeiting a trademark  the punishment for this offence is imprisonment for up to three years or a fine or both and Selling exposing or possessing for sale or any purpose of trade or manufacture any goods bearing a counterfeit mark the punishment for this offense is imprisonment for up to one year or a fine or both  Border measures are also available under the Imports and Exports Control Act  Under Section  of the Customs Act  the import of goods whether by air land or sea is prohibited that if any goods bearing registered trademarks are imported into or attempted to be exported out of Bangladesh in violation of the provision of Section  or of a notification under Section  such goods shall without prejudice to any other penalty to which the offender may be liable under this Act or any other law be liable to be detained and confiscated and shall be disposed of in such a manner as may be prescribed Moreover the Enforcement of IPR ImportExport Rules  also provides sufficient scope to detain and prohibit release of counterfeit products at the port if the right holder claims to the authority or the authority itself can detain and destroy the counterfeit goods  However there might be some limitations of the organizations regarding shortage of manpower as well as competency for enforcement of the laws As per needs assessments submitted in  under the purview of the TRIPS Agreement Bangladesh has not get adequate support to make its resources capable enough or up to the mark Though study suggests that many countries including some developed countries has been found to be the part of counterfeit guilty Bangladesh never support any sorts of illicit activities under IP protection It might be happened on the way to abroad sometimes some products were stolen and those were sold in the outside market The law enforcing agencies are also trying to discourse those points In case of social media pages the government is trying to implement the Digital Security Act against the criminal activities  Lastly the government of Bangladesh is always ready to work with the development partners to address any unfair trade activities and to build a foundation for best IP practices which will bring sustainable development for legitimate business with more jobs opportunities It is to be noted that a very highlevel committee headed by honourable Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister leading a committee to address IPR issues in Bangladesh and to prepare the country fully compliant with international best practices Bangladesh also expects proper guidelines and supports from WTO WIPO as well as bilateral support from other countries to work against counterfeit goods produce anywhere in the globe Moreover as a least developed country Bangladesh is trying its best to follow the TRIPS related issues through the domestic rules which have been improved in recent times We express our readiness for further discussion opportunities with the USTR on this issue    BD Response The claim Bangladesh a country where IPRS enforcement has become challenging for the brand owners is not true and not substantiated by any proof Bangladeshi producers are very much loyal to the brand owners and they always remain vigilant to protect the rights of the buyers It is not true that all the clothing products are directly exported from Bangladesh Products may go through a third country and attaching counterfeit tags are possible in those countries too UNIFABS mentioned that it is seem to be manufactured in Bangladesh is an assumption And based on such assumption a country cannot be solely blamed as a source of counterfeit goods  UNIFABs Claim UNIFABS claimed that In  the EUIPO mentioned Bangladesh as the third biggest source of counterfeit apparel detained by the EU Customs following China and Turkey EUIPO Report on the EU customs enforcement of intellectual property rights Results at the EU border    BD Response Report on the EU customs enforcement of intellectual property rights Results at the EU border  published in  did not identified Bangladesh as a major source of counterfeit clothing products The executive summary of the report mentioned the name of Bangladesh for pirated CD and DVD and Bangladesh is not a significant exporter of CDs and DVDs More over CDs and DVDs are obsolete products now a days The report mentioned Bangladesh in terms of clothing for a very insignificant percentage of seized clothing products The products were seized by the customs It was not proved by any competent authority that the seized products were counterfeit or not  UNIFABs Claim UNIFABS claimed that Bangladesh is also featured by the OECD as one of the top five provenance economies for counterfeit clothing globally OECDEUIPO Global Trade in Fakes   BD Response The OECD study has not identified Bangladesh even among the top  provenance economies of counterfeit and pirated goods Please see Figure  of the report where many developed and developing economies including USA sixth are listed as top  provenance economies The report also mentioned that  of global seizured counterfeit products came from five specific countries where Bangladesh is not in the list  UNIFABs Claim At the end of  Bangladeshi Customs implemented a sort of Custom recordal system However despite having filed a customs application for action in  it has not been accepted yet and many brand owners are in the same situation and ignore if there was any successful recordal Consequently Customs are not checking the products exported out of the country  BD Response Bangladesh customs authority National Board of Revenue enacted the IPR Enforcement Import Export Rules  to enforce Ip laws at the border Any information given by the right holders are taken seriously Many instanced are there that the case of confiscation had to resolved by the Supreme Court UNIFAB did not mention any specific case of such that was ignored by the customs authority The customs authority cannot verify  consignments For Risk Management it verifies a handful of consignments if no advance information is provided by the right holders    UNIFABs Claim Moreover the major issue in Bangladesh is that for brand owners it is currently challenging to enforce their IP rights for instance by conducting raids For example it seems that no successful raid has been conducted so far in the apparel sector Local legal partners and authorities are not willing to engage in activity that involves the garment trade in Bangladesh As a result the right holders cannot file any criminal complaint in order to raid manufacturers of counterfeit apparel It is also proved that some manufacturers that are members of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association BGMEA which represents the local legitimate industry conduct illicit activity by manufacturing and exporting counterfeit goods abroad  BD Response Bangladeshs IPR regime and IPR laws are not very new Some laws had been enacted since long ago Trademarks law and Copyrights law are being implemented rigorously Law enforcing agencies conduct raids based on the information given by the right holders and on the basis of the directives of the courts UNIFAB has mentioned no specific cases that had been failed or had been ignored by the law enforcing agencies It is a very unrealistic comment that right holders can not file criminal complaint in Bangladesh  BGMEA and BKMEA are always supportive to the brand owners There is no single case of negligence by these associations so far. It is also to be noted that These two associations have been actively working with ACCORD and ALIANCE along with brand owners to develop work place safety, labour rights, green production etc since 2013 and made a significant improvement in these areas. The associations are still working closely with brand owners to address all kinds of problems raised by the brand owners. 30. UNIFAB's Claim: \"In addition to that, there is no sufficient attention and/or awareness from the public sector to the issue of counterfeit apparel in Bangladesh. For now, we are still not aware of any training activities organized by Customs to allow right holders to raise awareness about the protection of their IP rights in the country.\" 31. BD Response: It is not true that the customs authority does not conduct any training programe for IPR enforcement. Section 15 of Customs Act, 1969 restricts imports of counterfeit goods (bearing false trade mark or fabricated trade description) into Bangladesh. IPR Enforcement (Import-Export) Rules 2019 empowered custos authority to enforce IPR at the border. NBR officials are trained fully with customs law and international practices including IPR enforcement properly. The Government of Bangladesh has been conducting awareness programmes on IPR targeting a smooth transition from the LDC status. 32. UNIFAB's Claim: “When it comes to trademark filings and prosecutions, the procedures are obviously lengthy, burdensome and expensive. For instance, the examination of trademark applications takes many years as opposed to the procedural timeline. It is the same for delays in insurance of trademark certificates, renewal certificates and recordal of assignment. Finally, it is the same for opposition proceedings that must be completed within 120 days in theory but seem to take much more time in practice. Anyway, in any case, the for conducting search and filings have been increased by 20% and 33%   4. The following Acts and Rules fully enforced in Bangladesh: National Innovation and Intellectual Property Policy 2018 The Trademarks Act, 2009 (Amended in 2015) The Trademarks Rules, 2015 The Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act, 2013 The Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Rules, 2015 Copyright Act, 2000 (Amended in 2005) Copyright Rules, 2006 Bangladesh Patent Act, 2022 Bangladesh Patent and Design Rules, 1933 Bangladesh Industrial Designs Act, 2022 The Plant Variety Protection Act-2019 IPR Enforcement (Import-Export) Rules 2019 5. It appears to be somewhat of a sweeping remark that there is no scope for conducting enforcement of intellectual property rights in Bangladesh. Any such remark clearly betrays knowledge about the existing legal regime as well as administrative and judicial procedures available in the country for any aggrieved rights holder to seem remedial actions. Since the submission is focused on counterfeit issues, the judicial remedies available under the concerned law are provided below. 6. The Trademark Act of 2009 provides both infringement suits and passing off actions in case of registered and unregistered trademarks respectively. In the case of infringement suits, the trademark must be registered in Bangladesh as per Section 24 (1) of this Act. In the case of civil proceedings, passing-off proceedings can be instituted before an assistant judge or a joint district judge. However, Trademark Infringement suits can be instituted only in a district court or higher. The Code of Civil Procedure establishes that rights holders may file suit for permanent injunctions before the Dhaka District Court. If the infringement is proved, a suit for damages may then be filed separately. 7. AAFA's Claim: AAFA also referred the OECD study and stated that \"The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ranked Bangladesh as one of the top five provenance economies for exporting counterfeit clothing, after China, Turkey, Hong Kong, and Vietnam. Bangladesh is also among the top counterfeiters in other categories, including leather articles and handbags, footwear, and jewelry.\" 8. BD Response: The OECD study as mentioned in footnote 10 of the petition has not identified Bangladesh even among the top 25 provenance economies of counterfeit and pirated goods (Please see Figure 4.1 of the report) where many developed and developing economies including USA (sixth) are listed as top 25 provenance economies. The report only identified Bangladesh as provenance economies with propensity to export counterfeit products with GTRIC-e rating as 0.661 which at serial 16th. The report also mentioned that 90% of global seizure counterfeit products came from five specific countries where Bangladesh is not in the list. Bangladesh was not also mentioned for counterfeiting source   for leather articles and handbags, footwear, and jewelry. Bangladesh is not even in the list of relative likelihood of countries for counterfeit of these products. 9. AAFA's Claim: AAFA also claimed that \"The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) has called out Bangladesh as the third biggest source of counterfeit clothing (ready-to-wear), following China and Turkey.\" 10. BD Response: “Report on the EU customs enforcement of intellectual property rights Results at the EU border, 2019\" which was mentioned by AAFA at footnote 11 did not identified Bangladesh as a major source of counterfeit clothing products. The executive summary of the report mentioned the name of Bangladesh for pirated CD and DVD and Bangladesh is not a significant exporter of Cd and DVD. More over CDs and DVDs are obsolete products now a days. The report mentioned Bangladesh in terms of clothing for a very insignificant percentage of seized clothing products. The products were seized by the customs. It was not proved by any competent authority that the seized products were counterfeit or not. 11. AAFA's Claim: AAFA also claimed that \"While seizures from across the globe can be traced back to Bangladesh, the two law enforcement agencies that have the authority to conduct IP enforcement actions in Bangladesh -the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and the Bangladesh Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID)—do_not_prioritize IP enforcement action and suffer from corruption. Apparel brands across the industry have not seen successful enforcement actions.\" 12. BD Response: It is not true that seized products must be counterfeited in Bangladesh. The importer also can add different brand name in the products in their territory after import. The association did not give any concrete proof or name any producer in Bangladesh who did those counterfeits. Every importing country has their customs authority to identify counterfeit products at its ports. Bangladesh also does the same. The IPR Enforcement (Import-Export) Rules 2019 gives full power to the customs authority to seize counterfeit products if right holder informs. The customs authority can seize such products sue moto also. They are actively engaged in their duties. 13. In Bangladesh Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and Bangladesh Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID) are not the only authority to enforce the IPR as mentioned. All the law enforcing agencies including customs, BSTI, Consumer Rights Authority can enforce the IPR laws. Actions are taken as soon as the information is given to the law enforcing agencies or at the courts. Numerous examples can be cited for such measures taken. 14. Under IPR Rules, rightsholders of trade marks must file notices/applications to the concerned commissioner on the import or export of goods infringing trademarks of the rightsholders. Based on the notices submitted by the rightsholders, Customs authority can initiate a legal process to address the issue. According to available information, since 2019 after the issuance of the Rules, only very recently on 3 January 2023 a rightsholder named H&M has submitted a notice to the Commissioner of Custom House, Chattogram, claiming   that trademarks of H& M are being infringed by some exporters while exporting clothing items under the brand name of M&H, which according to the claim-is using similar descriptive trademarks of H&M. This claim is now under the examination of Custom House, Chattogram and the issue will duly be addressed according to legal basis. 15. This IPR issue has been a priority issue for Bangladesh Customs in recent years. As a result, the IPR Enforcement Rules, 2019 was issued. Trademark rightsholders can now seek remedy against IPR infringement of their trademarked goods by non-rightsholders. Customs authority acts based on the applications filed by the rightsholders. However, Customs authorities on their own also are working to uphold IPR rights. For example: a consignment of Lactogrow and Lactogen-trademarked products of Nestle-was imported by an importer named Impex International other than Nestle Bangladesh through ICD Kamalapur Custom House. The House sent a letter on 16/1/23 to Nestle Bangladesh to re- view the consignment identifying IP rights of the importer. The issue is still unresolved. It was Customs that raised the IPR concern in this case. 16. Bangladesh Customs is taking action against import of counterfeit products by importers violating domestic legal provisions as well. For example: the production and supply of bandrolls and stamps for cigarettes for ensuring VAT deposits to government treasury lies with the Security Printing Corporation Bangladesh. However, two importers attempted to import two consignments of these items declaring art paper illegally to evade both import and domestic duties and taxes including VAT. Custom House, Chattogram seized the consignments on 14/12/2021 preventing huge loss of government revenues, amounting around Tk. 143 crore. 17. AAFA's Claim: AAFA claimed that \"the group found Bangladeshi sellers using social media and e-commerce platforms including Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Lazada, Shopee, and others to sell wholesale counterfeit goods globally.\" 18. BD Response: Firstly, Bangladesh is not very active online seller in the global market. None of the Bangladeshi online platform has cross border business. Shopee and Lazada are not Bangladeshi platforms. Bangladesh has a very strong guideline titled as “Digital Commerce Operation Guidelines 2021\" where display, sale or purchase of fake or counterfeit products are fully prohibited. Social media also maintains such policies. It is desirable that the domestic law of the host countries take necessary action. Bangladesh Government does not have any jurisdiction beyond its border to enforce IPR. 19. UNIFAB's Claim: UNIFABS claimed that \"This activity is one of the main economic activities of the country which contributes to making the enforcement of IPRs challenging for brand owners, particularly from the apparel industry. Bangladesh also seems to become a growing actor involved in the production of counterfeit apparel. Indeed, according to the information provided by customs and to the details appearing on the products themselves, more and more counterfeit apparel items seized, among the others, in Europe, UK, Saudi Arabia, UAE, the Philippines and other South-East Asian countries are directly exported from Bangladesh and seem to be manufactured in Bangladesh.   বাণিজ্য মন্ত্রণালয় গণপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলাদেশ সরকার ঢাকা No-26.00.0000.132.04.001.18.129 + Faldatabas Dear Sir, বাংলাদেশ সরকার MINISTRY OF COMMERCE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH DHAKA Dated: 24 February 2023 Subject: Rebuttal to USTR's Special 301 Review on IPR Protection and Enforcement about Bangladesh. Docket Number: USTR-2022-0016 Submitted electronically at  February 24, 2023 Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Innovation and Intellectual Property Office of the United State Trade Representatives 600 17th Street NW Washington DC 20508 In response to the allegation made by American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA) and Union Des Fabricants (UNIFAB) dated 30 January 2023 and 26 January 2023 respectively on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh a primary submission was made on 13 February 2023 in the Docket Number USTR-2022-0016 in response to Special 301 Review by the USTR on IPR Protection and Enforcement about Bangladesh. A detailed response to the complaints made by the AAFA and UNIFAB are given below: 2. AAFA's Complain- \"While being an important, legitimate sourcing country for the industry, counterfeits from Bangladesh are being seized at an increasing rate globally as counterfeit production is growing. As one member shared, “...it remains impossible to conduct any form of IP enforcement in Bangladesh due to zero established IP policies\" with high levels of corruption exacerbating the situation. Thus, AAFA recommends that Bangladesh be listed on USTR's Priority Watch List.\" 3. BD Response: AAFA claim is not supported by any evidence that the counterfeit production is growing in Bangladesh. More over the statement of a member of AAFA is not true at all. Being an LDC member of the WTO Bangladesh enjoys transition period under Article 66.1 from implementing any TRIPS rules other that MFN and National Treatment. But Bangladesh enforce many necessary law and rules to protect the intellectual property rights.   42. In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that a possible inclusion of Bangladesh under Section 301 for Special Review based on the submissions made by AAFA and UNIFAB would be unjustified and detrimental to the country's efforts to combat IP rights and promote the growth and development of its industries. We strongly urge USTR to consider those submissions in the right perspective, especially in light of its own recent acknowledgement of the progress made in Bangladesh with regard to IP protection. 43. Please feel free to revert for any clarification. Thank you for your time and consideration, Sincerely yours, 24/02/2023 Dr. Md. Alam Mostafa Joint Secretary WTO Wing, Ministry of Commerce, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Email: js1.wto@mincom.gov.bd   (approximately Bangladesh introduces amendments to the IP fee schedule (ip- coster.com)) and the fees for filing an opposition have increased by 150% (Country Guides - International Trademark Association (inta.org)).\" 33. BD Response: The Trade Marks Act, 2009 has specific provisions for filing application for trademarks and time limit for disposal. Fees for application and opposition are absolutely negligible comparing to developed countries. Fee for Trademark Registration is TK. 3500 (US$ 33) and fee for opposition of trademark is TK. 2000 (US$ 19). Overall Comments: 34. Bangladesh is a member of the WTO and is currently an LDC. As such the only obligations under the WTO TRIPS Agreement that are applicable on Bangladesh at present are the obligations to provide MFN and National Treatment. This is because Bangladesh is not required to implement the standard of IP protection or enforcement as mandated by TRIPS during the general transition period under Article 66.1 that is currently applicable to LDCs. 35. Nevertheless, Bangladesh provides adequate TRIPS consistent trademark protection, including against trademark counterfeiting, in accordance with the obligations applicable under TRIPS. The Trade Marks Act of 2009 makes false representation of a trademark a criminal offense and provides detailed provisions that define the offenses and their penalties and associated criminal procedures. In addition, the law also provides for civil remedies in suits for trademark infringement. These provisions in the Bangladesh law provide adequate and fair opportunity to all businesses impacted by trademark infringement to seek civil and criminal remedies as applicable through due process of the law. 36. The law enforcing agencies such as the police, the Border Guard of Bangladesh and the Rapid Action Battalion takes cognizance of any matter relating to counterfeiting only after being directed to by the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, since the limitation or use of false trademarks is a non-cognizable and a Bailable Offence under Sections 482, 483, 485 and 486 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 37. Besides civil infringement suit, IP rights holders may file an application for a temporary injunction under Order 39, Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If it is proved that there is a prima facie arguable case and that the balance of inconvenience is in the IP rights holder's favor, then the court may grant a temporary or interlocutory injunction against the counterfeiter when the suit is filed. 38. An IP right holder can seek remedy in the criminal courts too under the Bangladesh Penal Code, 1860 for using a false trademark so as to mislead consumers about the origin of the goods; and for counterfeiting a trademark used by another person. The punishment for using a false trademark is imprisonment for up to one year or a fine, or both. The punishment for counterfeiting is imprisonment for up to two years or a fine, or both. The courts also have the power to set the prison term and the amount of any fine. In addition, the Penal Code identifies a number of activities as a criminal offense and sets out various enforcement measures available to rights holders.\n",

As the 1997 Preamble to Commerce’s regulations explains: “the party alleging the existence of a ‘particular market situation’ . . . has the burden of demonstrating that there is a reasonable basis for believing that a ‘particular market situation’ exists.” 5 Given the exceptional nature of the PMS provision, there is no basis to modify this threshold burden on the party advocating for a PMS finding. In fact, doing so will only impose increased administrative burdens on the Department and the respondents in these proceedings, without any commensurate benefit to Commerce or the integrity of antidumping proceedings. Specifically, this proposal threatens to require them to address and analyze unfounded PMS allegations made with insufficient and speculative evidence. Commerce should retain the existing threshold in the Proposed Regulations.  2  Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties; Final Rule, 62 Fed.

The Preamble further provides that “the party claiming that a sale is not in the ‘ordinary course of trade’ has the burden of proof.” Id.  July 10, 2023 Page 4 B. The Proposed PMS Changes Inappropriately Lower the Standard for Finding a Cost-Based PMS Commerce’s Proposed Regulations would inappropriately lower the standard for finding a cost-based PMS in several significant respects. These are: i.  The Proposed PMS Changes Ignore the Statutory Requirement that a PMS Must “Prevent a Proper Comparison”  Under proposed regulation 19 C.F.R. § 352.416(a)(2), Commerce would only require a finding that the PMS “distorts” the cost of production, erroneously dropping the statutory requirement that there also be a finding that it “prevents a proper comparison” to the U.S. price. This proposal violates the first principle noted above: it is inconsistent with the governing statute. The statute defines PMS as follows: “Situations in which the administering authority determines that the particular market situation prevents a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price.”6 Thus, to determine the existence of a PMS, Commerce must find both that (1) there are “distortions present in the market” and (2) those distortions “prevent a proper comparison of normal value with export price or constructed export price.” 7 The U.S Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has expounded on this statutory definition and observed that subsidies must affect the price of an input such that it “does not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade.” 8 Moreover, the U.S.  6  19 U.S.C. § 1677(15)(C); see also 19 U.S.C. § 1677b(a)(1)((B)(ii)(III) and (C)(iii); and 19 U.S.C. § 1677b(e) (allowing for the use of an alternative constructed value calculation methodology “if a particular market situation exists such that the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind does not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade.”). 7  Husteel Co. Ltd. v. United States, 471 F. Supp. 3d 1349, 1362 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2020) (“To establish the existence of a PMS, Commerce must demonstrate both that there are distortions present in the market and that those distortions prevent a proper comparison of normal value with export price or constructed export price.”); Garg Tube Exp. v. United States, 569 F.Supp. 3d 1202, 1211 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2022) (finding that in addition to finding “unique market phenomena\" the use of the “causal phrase ‘such that’ requires” Commerce to “demonstrate that those market phenomena prevent the cost of materials and fabrication from accurately reflecting the cost of production.”). 8  Nexteel Co. Ltd. v. United States, 28 F.4th 1226, 1234 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (quoting 19 U.S.C. § 1677b(e)).  July 10, 2023 Page 5 Court of International Trade (CIT) has held that a PMS finding requires a demonstration “both that there are distortions present in the market and that those distortions prevent a proper comparison of normal value with export price or constructed export price.” 9 In other words, courts have concluded that a mere finding of some amount of distortion is inadequate to establish a PMS under the statute. Instead, the statute requires the Department to find that the distortion is to a level that prevents proper price comparisons. Commerce’s Proposed Regulations are inconsistent with the statute as they ignore the “prevent a proper comparison” provision and, instead, only require a finding of distortion. The Proposed Regulation would also appear to violate Article 2.2 of the WTO Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (“AD Agreement”), which also applies a “do not permit a proper comparison” threshold for determining when a PMS exists. ii.  The Proposed PMS Changes Improperly Amend the Requirement to Quantify the Impact of a PMS  Under the Proposed Regulation 19 C.F.R. § 351.416(d)(3)(i), Commerce will “not be required to consider” “{t}he lack of precision in the quantifiable data relating to the distortion of prices or costs in the subject country.” This formulation appears to be inconsistent with the statute and Commerce’s obligation to make findings based on a reasonable assessment of the substantial record evidence presented in each proceeding. The statute does not require Commerce to quantify the distortion “precisely”, 10 as noted above, but Congress has required a  9  Husteel Co., 471 F. Supp. 3d at 1362; Garg Tube, 569 F. Supp. 3d at 1214 (rejecting Commerce’s contention that distortions created by market phenomena automatically render the market unsuitable for comparison, because the “statute requires that the existence of a PMS must be ‘such that’ it renders the cost of fabrication and materials inaccurate”) 10  Nexteel Co. v. United States, 28 F.4th 1226, 1234 (Fed. Cir. 2002).  July 10, 2023 Page 6 demonstration that the PMS “prevents a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price.”11 This cannot be demonstrated without at least some level of quantification. Thus, rather than focusing on what Commerce should “not be required” to consider, the Proposed Regulations should focus instead on what Commerce is required to consider under the statute, which would then be evidence of the level of “significance” of the distortion in question. iii.  The Proposed PMS Changes Improperly Eliminate the Requirement that There Be a Causal Connection  The statute provides that “if a particular market situation exists such that the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind does not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade,” Commerce may “use another calculation methodology under this subtitle {Subtitle D of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended,}. . . or any other calculation methodology.”12 The CIT has interpreted the phrase “such that” as requiring that, in addition to finding unique market phenomena, Commerce must demonstrate how those market phenomena render the cost of materials and fabrication inaccurate in the ordinary course of trade. That is, Commerce must demonstrate a causal connection between identified market phenomena and how they prevent the cost of materials and fabrication from accurately reflecting the cost of production.13  11  19 U.S.C. § 1677(15)(C); see also 19 U.S.C. § 1677b(a)(1)((B)(ii)(III) and (C)(iii); and 19 U.S.C. § 1677b(e).  12  19 U.S.C. § 1677b(e) (emphasis added).  13  Garg Tube Exp. LLP v. United States, 600 F. Supp. 3d 1276, 1280 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2022); Garg Tube Exp. LLP v. United States, 569 F. Supp. 3d 1202, 1211–22 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2022) (“Commerce must therefore identify what unique facts render the cost of materials and fabrication an inaccurate reflection of the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade.”); Nexteel Co. v. United States, 569 F. Supp. 3d 1354, 1363 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2022) (“The language of section 1677b(e) ‘adopts both a comparative requirement and a causal requirement’ requiring Commerce to find the existence of one or more unique market phenomena and demonstrate how those market phenomena render the cost of materials and fabrication inaccurate in the ordinary course of trade.”); Hyundai Steel Co. v. United States, 581 F. Supp. 3d 1284, 1294 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2022) (remanding an affirmative PMS determination where it was unclear whether circumstances caused a PMS); Nexteel Co. v. United States, 601 F.  July 10, 2023 Page 7 Proposed Section 351.416(d) eliminates this unambiguous statutory “causal connection” requirement and replaces it with a much lower threshold. The Proposed Regulation only requires that “it is likely” that the alleged PMS contributed to the distortion. Commerce’s rationale for deviating from the unambiguous statutory “cause and effect” standard is that it “would allow many of these market-distorting situations to avoid being addressed as a PMS.” 14 This is neither a principled nor a statutorily-based rationale. Further, as the CIT’s interpretation of this causal requirement is grounded in the unambiguous terms of the operative statute, Commerce cannot simply override it in its regulations. Moreover, this revised standard, which would allow Commerce to determine a distinct circumstance or set of circumstances to be a particular market situation when “it is likely that” the circumstances “contributed to the fact” that prices or costs are not in accordance with marketbased principles, would result in determinations that are based on mere speculation. As Commerce elsewhere recognizes,15 a determination that is based on speculation is inherently unsupported by substantial evidence. Further, such a determination would expose the Department to reversal on appeal.16 Commerce should adopt the current standard that requires a  Supp. 3d 1373, 1377 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2022) (Commerce acknowledges that it “cannot show both a comparative and a causal connection between particular market phenomena” and accordingly cannot address the Court’s concerns regarding whether substantial evidence exists on the record). 14  Proposed Regulation, 88 Fed. Reg. at 29,866.  15  Proposed Regulation 19 C.F.R. § 351.416(d)(3)(ii) (stating that Commerce should not be required to consider “speculative evidence” regarding the cost of subject merchandise or the prices or costs of any inputs into the production of subject merchandise). 16  Yangzhou Bestpak Gifts & Crafts Co. v. United States, 716 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (holding that the substantial evidence standard requires “Commerce to examine the record and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action” and “Commerce may not base that determination ‘on the basis of mere conjecture or supposition.’”) (citing 19 U.S.C. § 1677(7)(F)(ii)).  July 10, 2023 Page 8 causal connection between the identified market phenomena and the distortion in the cost of materials and fabrication that prevents them from accurately reflecting the cost of production. iv.  The Proposed PMS Changes Ignore the Statutory Requirement that the Market Situation be “Particular”  Proposed § 351.416(e) provides a definition of the statutory term “particular” that is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the word. Both the CIT and the Federal Circuit recognize that the statutory requirement imposed on the Department that a market situation be “particular” means it must be specific to a home market country. 17 Thus, “{a}n ongoing global phenomenon would not alone constitute a deviation from the ‘ordinary course of trade.’” 18 And “the circumstances supporting a ‘particular’ market situation also must be ‘particular’ to producers of the subject merchandise during the relevant period.”19 Commerce’s Proposed Regulations, at Section 351.416(e), ignore this statutory requirement by defining “particular” in such a way that the term would essentially become meaningless. For example, Section 351.416(e)(ii) provides that a market situation can be “particular” “even if a large number of distinct products or parties are impacted by the circumstance or set of circumstances.” This proposal violates the overarching principle described above that Commerce’s regulations must be consistent with the enabling statute. Moreover, at various points in the Proposed Regulations, Commerce substitutes “distinct” for “particular.” For example, in proposed Section 351.416(d)(1), Commerce refers to a “distinct circumstance or set of circumstances.” This is not the statutory term.  17  SeAH Steel Corp. v. United States, 513 F. Supp. 3d 1367, 1393–94 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2021).  18  Nexteel Co. v. United States, 28 F.4th 1226, 1234 (Fed. Cir. 2022).  19  Id.  July 10, 2023 Page 9 v.  The Proposed PMS Changes to the Definition of “Ordinary Course of Trade” Violate the Plain Meaning of the Statute  Likewise, proposed Section 351.416(d)(3)(iv) provides a definition for “ordinary course of trade” that is inconsistent with the plain meaning of that statutory provision. The statute defines “ordinary course of trade” as “the conditions and practice which, for a reasonable time prior to the exportation of the subject merchandise have been normal in the trade under consideration with respect to merchandise of the same class or kind.” 20 Commerce has previously recognized that this definition of “ordinary course of trade” does not encompass historical policies or actions that have been in effect for many years. 21 Commerce’s Proposed Regulations nullify this timing requirement in the statute by asserting that the Secretary “will not be required to consider” “{t}he existence of historical policies and previous actions taken or not taken by the government or industry in the subject country with respect to the subject merchandise or a significant input into the production of subject merchandise.”22 This proposal violates the first principle set forth above that Commerce’s regulations must be consistent with the enabling statute. Any other approach would be contrary to law. C. Certain Proposed Examples of New Categories of PMS That “May” be Found Actionable Do Not Meet the Statutory Criteria Certain proposed PMS examples do not appear to meet the statutory criteria. These are:  20  19 U.S.C. § 1677(15).  21  Softwood Lumber Products from Canada, 85 Fed. Reg. 7,282 (Dep’t of Commerce Feb. 7, 2020) (preliminary results), and accompanying “Decision on Particular Market Situation Allegation,” dated Jan. 31, 2020, at 8 (noting that “{t}he length of time that cogeneration facilities have been in place undermines the argument that their potential impact on cost of production represents a departure from the ordinary course of trade such that they give rise to a PMS.”). 22  Proposed Regulation 19 C.F.R. § 351.416(d)(3)(iv).  July 10, 2023 Page 10 i.  Limits on Exports  Proposed Regulation 19 C.F.R. § 351.416(g)(4) would have Commerce apply a presumption that, when a government “limits exports of a significant input into the production of subject merchandise,” “such export limitations are likely to contribute to price or cost distortions of that input in the subject country.”23 This is an inappropriate and unwarranted presumption. Limits on exports of a significant input are an insufficient basis for finding a PMS. At a minimum, there would need to be a finding that these limits demonstrably distort the cost of that input, and that those distortions in turn impact the cost of production to such an extent that they prevent a “proper comparison.” As noted above, consistent with the statute, this requires a significant level of distortion. ii.  Supply/Demand Imbalance  Proposed Regulation 19 C.F.R. § 351.416(g)(4)(1) provides as an example example of a PMS a situation where “there is considerably more supply than demand {for a significant input into the production of subject merchandise} in international markets.” The Proposed Regulations further state this situation would be apt to constitute an actionable PMS “where the record reflects that, regardless of the impact of such overcapacity of the significant input on other countries, such overcapacity is likely to contribute to distortions of the price or cost of that input in the subject country.” This formulation ignores the statutory requirements discussed above that: (1) any distortions “prevent a proper comparison of normal value with export price or constructed export price;” and (2) that the market situation be “particular.” Further, the “likely to contribute” standard is highly speculative and would not constitute substantial evidence.  23  Proposed Regulation 19 C.F.R. § 351.416(g)(4).  July 10, 2023 Page 11 D. The Proposed PMS Changes Regarding What Commerce May Consider in Quantifying a PMS Ignore the Statute and Must Be Clarified Commerce’s Proposed Regulation, 19 C.F.R. § 351.416(f), providing for adjustments for a PMS, also continues to ignore the “prevents a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price”24 prong of the statute. First, Commerce states that it “may address distortions to the cost of production in its calculations.” Rather than addressing simple “distortions,” the adjustments made by the Department should be limited to “significant distortions.” Second, Commerce explains that “it may use any reasonable methodology to determine an appropriate adjustment to its calculations,” “after consideration of the relevant information that is available.” The phrase “that is available” is unclear because Commerce’s determinations are limited to its administrative record, and this phrase implies that Commerce could consider information beyond what is on its record. This would of course violate Commerce’s evidentiary and due process obligations. Accordingly, Commerce should change the phrase “consideration of the relevant information that is available” to “consideration of the information on the record before it in the relevant proceeding.” 2. The Proposed Change Allowing Commerce to Ignore Recent Relevant Authority Prioritizes Administrative Efficiency over Fairness Proposed new Regulation 19 C.F.R. § 351.301(c)(6) provides timing restrictions on when parties may provide notice of subsequent authority that is “directly relevant to an issue in an ongoing segment of the proceeding.” Specifically, Commerce will only be required to consider and address a Notice of Subsequent Authority that is submitted 30 days or more before the  24  19 U.S.C. § 1677(15)(C); see also 19 U.S.C. § 1677b(a)(1)((B)(ii)(III) and (C)(iii); and 19 U.S.C. § 1677b(e) (allowing for the use of an alternative constructed value calculation methodology “if a particular market situation exists such that the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind does not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade.”).  July 10, 2023 Page 12 deadline for issuing the final determination or results. While the Canadian Governments recognize that administering agencies often face challenging deadlines, this proposal could allow Commerce to ignore highly relevant legal authority. Reviewing courts or panels typically consider subsequent authority that could have altered the result as an exception to the principle of exhaustion. The reason for this is the principle that a court should not apply the law in a way that leads to a “plain miscarriage of justice.”25 Thus, Rule 28(j) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure permits parties to raise significant authorities if they come to a party’s attention after the party’s brief has been filed or after oral argument but before a decision, and Parties typically invoke CIT Rule 7(b) when asking for leave to file a supplemental brief on subsequent authority. Likewise, Rule 68 of the Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational Panel Review also provides that a participant may raise subsequent authorities before and after oral argument. Commerce’s proposal would excuse Commerce from considering any subsequent authority that is submitted within 30 days of the deadline for issuing the final determination or results. This would force parties to bring unnecessary appeals of Commerce’s determinations or results, as under Commerce’s proposal this would be the only way to have Commerce address this subsequent authority despite being legally bound by it. Commerce’s proposal also would engender substantial work for Commerce as the agency would be forced to render decisions that it knows are inconsistent with law as of their issuance, and then would need to take remands in the CIT, or before a Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement panel, in order to remedy its knowingly unlawful decisions.  25  Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U.S. 552, 558 (1941); see also First Heights Bank, FSB v. United States, 422 F.3d 1311, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (ordering parties to provide supplemental briefing sua sponte to obtain parties’ views on a court decision that was issued after briefing).  July 10, 2023 Page 13 A better way to address Commerce’s concerns about having sufficient time to address subsequent authority while balancing fairness to the parties would be (1) to provide that Commerce should extend any possible deadlines to allow it to address that subsequent authority; and (2) if there are no more deadlines to extend, reduce the cut-off point for addressing subsequent authority to fifteen days before the ultimate deadline for any final determination or results. 3. Additional Proposed Changes that Provide Greater Discretion to Commerce and  Reduce Predictability Contradict the Statute Commerce proposes several novel provisions that would allow it greater discretion in the calculation of benefit. In particular: (1) Proposed Regulation 19 C.F.R. § 351.509(d) provides Commerce with greater discretion in terms of deciding when a tax is tied to a particular market or product; and (2) Proposed Regulation 19 C.F.R. § 351.525 gives Commerce more discretion in terms of how it will attribute export and domestic subsidies. Under these proposals, Commerce would be able to use alternative methodologies to attribute export subsidies and domestic subsidies to certain products exported and/or sold by a firm, including the attribution of a subsidy to multinational production in certain circumstances. In essence, these provisions would provide Commerce with increased flexibility in assessing how to allocate the benefit of a subsidy across exports. It is not at all clear how or when Commerce might exercise this discretion, nor does the preamble indicate why Commerce needs such discretion or how it intends to exercise it.26  26  The preamble to the Proposed Regulation only says that, because “governments have developed more complicated and unique subsidy programs around the world,” therefore “at some point in the future Commerce may encounter a unique type of subsidy program that warrants an allocation of an export or domestic subsidy in a manner that is otherwise not contemplated by the language of existing § 351.525(b)(2) and (3).” Proposed Regulation, 88 Fed. Reg. at 29,870.  July 10, 2023 Page 14 As indicated above, any countervailable benefits must be calculated based on the facts and merchandise at issue—to the extent the Department needs to depart from its standard rules, it should articulate a principled basis for doing so. In particular, Commerce’s proposal to permit flexible attribution of the benefit of a subsidy, including to multinational production in some circumstances, would contradict 19 U.S.C. § 1671(a)(1), which states that Commerce must establish that the government or public entity is providing, directly or indirectly, a countervailable subsidy with respect to the manufacturing, production, or export of the merchandize under investigation.27 4. The Proposed Change Creating a Default Position to Ignore Net Costs of Respondents In Relation to Alleged Subsidy Programs Is Inconsistent with the Statute The proposed second paragraph of Regulation 19 C.F.R. § 351.503 suggests the establishment in Commerce’s regulations of a default position that the agency will not consider the “net costs” to respondents of an alleged subsidy program. For instance, if a firm accrues additional costs through compliance with government obligations, those costs necessary to request, accept and/or implement government assistance need not be part of Commerce’s benefit analysis of a potential subsidy. This proposed change to the regulations is inconsistent with the enabling statute. Section 771(6) of the Tariff Act of 1930 requires Commerce to subtract from the gross countervailable subsidy received “any application fee, deposit, or similar payment paid in order to qualify for, or to receive, the benefit of the countervailable subsidy.” This unambiguous  27  See also Changzhou Trina Solar Energy Co. v. United States, 352 F.Supp.3d 1316, 1353–54 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2018); Borusan Mannesmann Boru Sanayi Ve Ticaret A.S. v. United States, 61 F. Supp. 3d 1306, 1347 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2015) (“{i}f a subsidy is tied to the production or sale of a particular product, {Commerce} will attribute the subsidy only to that product.”).  July 10, 2023 Page 15 statutory requirement to calculate a “net countervailable subsidy” obligates Commerce to account for “(A) any application fee, deposit, or similar payment paid in order to qualify for, or to receive, the benefit of the countervailable subsidy.” As such, compliance costs incurred to qualify and/or receive a countervailable subsidy may not be included in the “net countervailable subsidy,” depending on the record evidence presented to Commerce. Commerce is also obligated to account for costs incurred in the receipt of a subsidy through the “less than adequate remuneration” prong of the statute, 19 U.S.C. § 1677(5)(E). That prong governs Commerce’s assessment of whether the provision of a good or service by a government authority provides a benefit to the recipient. The statute requires Commerce to assess whether a good is provided for “less than adequate remuneration” in relation to the “prevailing market conditions” for the good in the country of provision. The statute defines “prevailing market conditions” to include conditions such as “price, quality, availability, marketability, transportation, and other conditions of purchase or sale.” 28 Thus, the statute requires Commerce to account for the full costs associated with a respondent’s eligibility for and receipt of any alleged benefit from purported countervailable subsidies. Commerce may not disregard such costs as Commerce proposes under these Regulations. 5. The Proposed Change to Allocation Periods Would Not Be Specific to Subject Merchandise Commerce proposes to change the allocation period for equity infusions (351.507(d)) and debt forgiveness (351.508(c)(1)) to the same time period applied to a non-recurring subsidy or a period of 12 years, whichever is longer. The preamble to the Proposed Rule explains this was added because in DRAMS from Korea a massive government bailout was only offset for a  28  19 U.S.C. § 1677(5)(E)(iv).  July 10, 2023 Page 16 limited period of time, which was regarded as “unreasonable.” 29 However, in accordance with the third principle articulated above, the allocation period must relate to the particular subject merchandise at issue in a given case. With respect to the allocation period for equity infusions, Commerce must take into account the “average useful life” of the merchandise under investigation or review. The proposed 12-year period does not relate to the subject merchandise at issue, so it violates the third principle articulated above. 6. Consolidation of Scope Records in the AD Proceeding and Scope Clarifications Could Preclude Government Parties from Participating in Scope Proceedings and Would Not Provide Adequate Notice In Proposed Regulation 19 C.F.R. § 351.104(a)(1), Commerce provides that the record of the AD segment, as opposed to the CVD segment, will normally be the official record for scope, circumvention, and covered merchandise segments covering companion AD and CVD orders. Since Governments do not typically make appearances in AD proceedings and are typically not under APOs in those proceedings, this structure disadvantages them. Further, it is not clear why any preliminary scope rulings are not placed on the record of the CVD proceeding until after the Secretary issues a final scope ruling.30 Preliminary scope rulings should be placed on the record of the CVD proceeding at the time of issuance. While the Proposed Regulations provide some ability to move scope-related, circumvention-related, and covered-merchandise-related business proprietary information (“BPI”) from a segment of these inquiries to subsequent AD or CVD segments, as authorized by  29  Proposed Regulations, 88 Fed. Reg. at 29,868 (citing Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Dynamic Random Access Memory Semiconductors from the Republic of Korea, 68 Fed. Reg. 37,122 (Dep’t of Commerce June 23, 2003 (DRAMS from Korea), and accompanying issues and decision memorandum at Comment 8). 30  Proposed Regulations 19 C.F.R. §§ 351.525(m)(2); 351.226(m)(2), and 351.227(m)(2).  July 10, 2023 Page 17 the APO,31 governmental parties that were not under the APO in the AD proceeding may not be qualified to do so. Thus, while we appreciate the Department’s desire not to maintain duplicate records in cases pertaining to companion AD and CVD proceedings, the consolidation of these scope/circumvention/covered merchandise records in the AD proceedings creates complexities and potentially precludes certain parties from relying on information from these inquiries in other segments of AD and CVD orders or actively participating in these inquiries, despite authorization under the APO of a CVD proceeding. Additionally, in Proposed Regulations 19 C.F.R. § 351.225(q), Commerce states that “scope clarifications can take different forms,” such as footnotes to a scope, a memorandum in the context of an ongoing segment of a proceeding, and a standalone “Notice of Scope Clarification.” Issuing scope clarifications in the context of an ongoing segment, however, does not provide sufficient notice to all parties that may be affected by such clarifications in the proceeding. Instead, to properly provide notice, Commerce should include the scope clarifications, which it intends to cover by this Proposed Regulation, in the Federal Register notices relating to the administrative order at issue, as well as in the “Notice of Scope Rulings” that it publishes quarterly in the Federal Register. 32 7. The Proposed Change Granting Commerce Discretion to Treat a Loan as a Grant Should be Clarified and the Time Period is Arbitrary In Proposed Regulation 19 C.F.R. § 351.505(d), Commerce provides that it will treat a loan as a grant if no payments of interest and principal are made in three years, unless the loan recipient can demonstrate that nonpayment is consistent with the terms of a comparable  31  Proposed Regulation 19 C.F.R. § 351.306.  32  See e.g., Notice of Scope Rulings, 88 Fed. Reg. 32,731 (Dep’t of Commerce May 22, 2023).  July 10, 2023 Page 18 commercial loan it could obtain on the market. The Department should change the language of the Proposed Regulation to clarify that a loan is not to be treated as a grant as long as a payment of interest or principal is made within the prescribed time period. 33 Additionally, the three-year period is arbitrary, in that Commerce acknowledges that it is not based on an industry standard, and on this basis it is inappropriate to shift the burden to a respondent to show that it could obtain a comparable loan for an arbitrarily short period of time. 8. The Proposed Change Setting Out the “New Private Investor” Standard Must Be Clarified In Proposed Regulation 19 C.F.R. § 351.507(c), Commerce proposes that an analysis of whether a “new private investor” would make an equity investment in the firm should depend on whether an “outside private investor” would do so, rather than whether a “private investor who has already invested in the firm would continue to invest in the firm.” Commerce first references a “new private investor”, then refers to the investor as an “outside private investor.” It should clarify whether it intends for these two terms to mean the same thing. In addition, the distinction Commerce makes between a “new private investor” and an investor who has already made an equity investment is not logical from an economic perspective. 9. Commerce Should Not Place New Factual Information on the Record of Proceedings without Permitting Parties to Comment and Provide Rebuttal New Factual Information Proposed modification to Section 351.301(c)(4) would allow Commerce to place on the record relevant “analysis or calculation memoranda issued in another segment or proceeding,” even after the record has closed, and would not re-open the record for parties to provide rebuttal new factual information (“NFI”). This proposal is contrary to Commerce’s practice under its  33  Proposed Regulation, 88 Fed. Reg. at 29,867.  July 10, 2023 Page 19 current regulation,34 and raises important due process concerns. This proposal would strip interested parties of their right to provide rebuttal NFI in violation of fundamental principles of due process. This will give the administrating authority the last word on the factual record, not the parties who are responsible for building that record. 35 Commerce’s current regulations at 19 C.F.R. § 351.301(c)(4) permits parties to submit rebuttal factual information in response to NFI placed on the record by Commerce. In enacting this provision, Commerce explained that this opportunity to submit factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct that factual information was necessary “to ensure transparency and active and meaningful participation by parties.”36 The same concerns persist today. If Commerce is permitted to place NFI on the record, then the parties to a proceeding must continue to be permitted to offer rebuttal, clarificatory, and corrective NFI in response. Further, Commerce must explain why it is supplementing the record with NFI if this occurs after the preliminary determination and the record is already closed. Respondents cannot provide meaningful comments on the new evidence if they are left guessing as to its relevance. *  34  *  *  Proposed Rule, 88 Fed.

That report is available at  entertainment 4 See, e.g., 2022 Essential Facts About the Video Game Industry, available at  the-Video-Game-Industry.pdf (highlighting the benefits of playing video games including \"fostering connection in person and online, building new skills and ways of thinking, [and] promoting health and driving economic growth.\").

Dynamic digital market conditions, including fair and equitable market access, create enormous opportunities to further expand economic growth, which results in more well-paying jobs and foreign sales. CIIPA International Intellectual Property Alliance IIPA 2023 Special 301 Letter to USTR, January 30, 2023, page ii The benefits to American creators, producers, and workers are demonstrated in IIPA's December 2022 update of its comprehensive economic report, Copyright Industries in the U.S. Economy: The 2022 Report, prepared by Secretariat Economics, Inc. (2022 Report). According to the 2022 Report, in 2021, the \"core\" copyright industries in the United States: (i) generated more than $1.8 trillion of economic output; (ii) accounted for 7.76% of the entire economy; and (iii) employed approximately 9.6 million workers, which is nearly 4.9% of the entire U.S. workforce and over 5.5% of total private employment in the United States. 5 The jobs created by these industries are well-paying jobs; for example, copyright industry workers earn on average 51% higher wages than other U.S. workers. Further, according to the 2022 Report, the core copyright industries outpaced the U.S. economy, growing at an aggregate annual rate of 6.15% between 2018 and 2021, while the U.S. economy grew by 1.76%. When factoring in other industries that contribute to the copyright economy (which together comprise what the 2022 Report calls the \"total\" copyright. industries), the numbers are even more compelling. The 2022 Report and statistics amply demonstrate the economic importance of the copyright industries to the U.S. economy and to the livelihoods of millions of American workers. The global health crisis unleashed by the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on individuals, governments, and industries around the world. The copyright sector is no different. While the creative industries have adapted and responded to the crisis by making available more online resources for both distance learning and entertainment through flexible licensing mechanisms, these businesses are themselves contending with economic stresses. Some of these stresses are evident in the 2022 Report, yet the report shows that the copyright industries continued to be a significant contributor to the United States economy and will likely remain so when the impact of the virus has been mitigated. For example, while U.S. GDP decreased by 2.77% from 2019 to 2020, reflecting the strain of the pandemic, the core copyright industries' value added grew by 0.89% during that time period, and that growth accelerated to nearly 13% in 2021. Thus, especially in the wake of the pandemic, the need for strong copyright protection remains critical to incentivize the investment in the creation and dissemination of entertaining, informative, and educational content. On behalf of its member associations, IIPA has filed comments every year since the 1988 Trade Act established the Special 301 review proceeding. A particular focus of this IIPA submission is on the improvements necessary to the legal frameworks of trading partners to further enhance digital trade in copyrighted works and sound recordings. For more than two decades, the copyright industries have been at the forefront of digital technological advances, creating and disseminating copyrighted materials using a wide variety of media and ever-more sophisticated systems (including new services and applications (apps)) and new digital business models. For example, the 2022 5 See Secretariat Economists, Copyright Industries in the U.S. Economy: The 2022 Report (December 16, 2022) available at  Core copyright industries are those whose primary purpose is to create, produce, distribute, or exhibit copyright materials. The link between copyright protection and economic growth has been well documented by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). See, e.g., WIPO Studies on the Economic Contribution of the Copyright Industries: Overview (2014), available at  The WIPO website provides links to 51 country studies employing virtually the same agreed-upon methodology as the methodology used by Secretariat Economists. See  These studies provide the economic underpinnings for efforts to reform copyright laws, improve enforcement, and lower market access barriers. For the video game industry, see a December 2020 report by ESA Video Games in the 21st Century: The 2020 Economic Impact Report, available  This report highlights how video games not only provide rich interactive entertainment experiences, but also power an innovative industry that has a significant impact on U.S. economic growth and jobs. For the music industry (RIAA), see the 2020 Jobs & Benefits Report:  Music-Industries-Jobs-Benefits-2020-Report.pdf and the 50 States of Music website -  - that provides (qualitative and quantitative) state-by-state contributions. There are also music industry reports on employment and economic contributions in specific regions, e.g., Europe, available at  as well as in specific countries, e.g., India, available at  For the motion picture economic contribution infographic, available at  2020 content/uploads/2022/01/MPA_US_Economic_Contribution_2020_Final.pdf.

These reports illustrate the economic value of the production and distribution of motion picture and television programs, and include analyses of direct and indirect economic impacts (i.e., employment and tax analyses).   CIIPA International Intellectual Property Alliance® IIPA 2023 Special 301 Letter to USTR, January 30, 2023, page iii Report demonstrates that in 2021 the copyright industries contributed significantly to the digital economy, as defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), with the core copyright industries accounting for over 52% of the digital economy value added and over 48% of digital economy employment and the total copyright industries accounting for nearly 65% of the digital economy value added and nearly 59% of digital economy employment. The report points out that these numbers likely understate the total contribution of the copyright industries to the digital economy, because the BEA's digital economy classification does not encompass the full range of the copyright industries' digital activities. The end result of these digital technological advances is that more copyrighted material is now legally available, in more diversified ways and with more varied pricing options than at any other time in history, for the enrichment and enjoyment of consumers. Though the copyright sector is increasingly employing electronic means to produce and deliver its products and services to meet global consumer demand, laws and enforcement regimes in many foreign markets have failed to keep pace. The success of the creative community in digital trade depends on strong copyright laws and enforcement practices that foster a legitimate online economy. Open markets and modern copyright laws, when combined with effective and efficient enforcement of those laws, have resulted in creators and producers investing in the creation and dissemination of new high-quality materials, ultimately meeting worldwide consumer demand. To maximize market potential, rights holders must remain at the forefront of technological developments to expand markets and creative activity and to launch new business models. IIPA members very much appreciate that USTR has made the Special 301 process a positive catalyst for change to effectively address the challenges faced by the U.S. creative industries in key markets around the world. In our view, the process continues to yield results, including positive legal reforms, enforcement actions, and the removal of market access barriers. In addition to recommending improvements, IIPA's comments also highlight some of the recent successes and positive outcomes in several countries. IIPA RECOMMENDATIONS ON DESIGNATIONS AND A SUMMARY OF COUNTRY REPORTS I. IIPA's submission focuses on the markets where IIPA members believe active engagement by the U.S. government can reap positive results for creators and the industries that support and invest in them. The Country Reports contained in the filing include a summary of developments from 2022 along with key issues to focus on in 2023. Most of the Country Reports identify key priorities and, wherever possible, detail the legal, enforcement, and market access concerns specific to each market. Some Country Reports also contain details of specific trade obligations to the United States in bilateral or multilateral trade agreements or identify unfulfilled obligations that, if addressed, could improve the local market. In a few instances, the Country Reports focus on only a few key issues or one or two industries. IIPA's 2023 Submission includes this Cover Letter plus two appendices-Appendix A and Appendix B. 7 Appendix A includes 20 Country Reports with recommendations for designation in USTR's Special 301 Report this year. These 20 Country Reports cover: Argentina; Brazil; Canada; Chile; China; Colombia; Ecuador; India; Indonesia; Mexico; Nigeria; Peru; Poland; Russian Federation; South Africa; Switzerland; Taiwan; Thailand; United Arab Emirates; and Vietnam. For these countries, the IIPA recommends: 6 For example, there are now over 60 million licensed tracks on some of the major music streaming services.

Members of IIPA include: Association of American Publishers (www.publishers.org), Entertainment Software Association (www.theesa.com), Independent Film & Television Alliance (www.ifta-online.org), Motion Picture Association (www.motionpictures.org), and Recording Industry Association of America (www.riaa.com). Collectively, IIPA's five member associations represent over 3,200 U.S. companies producing and distributing copyrightable content. The materials produced and/or distributed by IIPA-member companies include: entertainment software (including interactive video games for consoles, handheld devices, personal computers, and the Internet) and educational software; motion pictures, television programming, DVDs and home video, and digital representations of audiovisual works; music recorded in all formats (from digital files to CDs and vinyl) for streaming and other online services, as well as broadcasting, public performance, and synchronization in audiovisual materials; and fiction and non-fiction books, educational, instructional and assessment materials, and professional and scholarly journals, databases, and software in all formats. INITIATIVES TO STRENGTHEN IP PROTECTION AND ENFORCEMENT IN FOREIGN MARKETS IIPA highlights positive developments in the following markets in the past year: Brazil: The Brazilian Audio-Visual Agency (ANCINE) created an anti-piracy chamber, and the Ministry of Justice's National Council to Combat Piracy and Intellectual Property Crimes (CNCP) has pursued several helpful voluntary initiatives to fight illegal activity. The Ministry of Justice has consistently deployed raids against online piracy, such as the recurrent waves of Operation 404,9 with the most recent wave focused on large numbers of infringing 8 A number of countries/territories have appeared on a Special 301 list every year since 1989, or for a considerable number of years. A 1994 amendment to Section 182 of the Trade Act, dealing with identification of \"priority foreign countries,\" provides that USTR must consider \"the history of intellectual property laws and practices in the foreign country, whether the country has been identified as a priority foreign country previously, and U.S. efforts to obtain adequate and effective intellectual property protection in that country.\" Uruguay Round Agreements Act Statement of Administrative Action, reprinted in H.R. Doc. No. 103-316, vol. I, at 362 (1994). ⁹ Operation 404 aims to tackle infringing services online, coordinated by the Brazilian Ministry of Justice and Public Security, together with cybercrime police units from 11 states in Brazil, Homeland Security Investigations (US), and the Police IP Crime Unit, City of London Police (UK).   ⒸIIPA International Intellectual Property Alliance IIPA 2023 Special 301 Letter to USTR, January 30, 2023, page v mobile apps, and regulatory agencies have recently improved their focus on combatting illicit streaming devices (ISDs), although current efforts on ISDs remain insufficient given the scale of the problem. In addition, positive progress has been made regarding disabling access to infringing websites. On August 10, 2021, the Tribunal of Justice of the State of São Paulo issued a permanent blocking order against 14 stream-ripping sites in the criminal case initiated by the recorded music industry's anti-piracy body, APDIF DO BRASIL (APDIF). The decision was part of the campaign developed by APDIF and the Unit against Cyber Crimes of the State of São Paulo's Prosecutors Office (Cyber-GAECO), and the first of its kind in Brazil against music piracy services, confirming the legal powers of Brazilian courts to order permanent injunctions in cases against foreign sites with a significant audience in Brazil. More recently, on September 23, 2022, the Tribunal of Justice of the State of Sao Paulo, following a request from Cyber-GAECO, granted a dynamic injunction for blocking against 40 major stream-ripping services for an initial period of 180 days. While these developments are encouraging, as discussed in the Brazil country report, the government should make additional improvements to Brazil's copyright enforcement framework. Canada: In June 2022, Parliament passed Bill C-19 to amend the Copyright Act to extend the general term of copyright protection. As discussed in the Canada Country Report, IIPA encourages the government of Canada to meet its U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) commitment by swiftly enacting this bill. India: India established a site-blocking remedy in 2019 and, in 2022, rightsholders achieved two new milestones. First, rights holders obtained orders to block \"pirate brand\" domains based on their apparent association with an already-blocked site. This will create further efficiencies and help disrupt persistent infringers who mimic the name or brand of popular pirate sites to attract traffic and ad revenues to their copycat sites. Rights holders also obtained the first blocking orders against a cyberlocker, allowing blocking of server domains associated with cyberlockers shown to be servicing referral sites with massive infringements. In addition, in February 2022, the Delhi High Court Intellectual Property Rights Division Rules entered into force. The Rules establish an IP Division of the Delhi High Court and are intended to ensure that the judges hearing IP cases are well versed in IP laws and practice. These rules have had a positive impact on the adjudication of IP cases to date and could provide a model for other states. Finally, in May 2022, the Supreme Court of India held that offenses under Section 63 of the Copyright Act are cognizable and non-bailable offenses. This decision improves the police's ability to effectively respond to copyright infringements committed within their jurisdictions. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry should analyze, and, as necessary, seek to amend any penal provisions or ancillary provisions related to Section 63 that may be inconsistent with this Supreme Court judgment. Kenya: In early 2022, a bill proposed by a Member of Parliament to repeal online enforcement provisions (including notice and takedown obligations) was withdrawn, following strong opposition by Kenya's Copyright Office, as well as local and international rights holders. It is important for Kenya to effectively and consistently implement notice and takedown and other measures demonstrated effective in preventing or restraining infringement to help address online piracy. As discussed below, IIPA encourages the U.S. and Kenyan governments to work together to ensure that legislative reforms are consistent with international obligations and standards and provide protection for foreign and domestic rights holders alike. Malaysia: In March 2022, new anti-ISD amendments to the Copyright Act entered into force. Pursuant to these new amendments, the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE), Premier League, and Malaysia's Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (MDTCA) in October 2022 undertook a joint enforcement action against an electronics retailer for allegedly selling ISDs. Mexico: In 2022, the ESA entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property (IMPI) to work together on issues impacting video game IP protection and enforcement. The MOU focuses on collaboration on IP enforcement activities, promotion of the importance of IP, public awareness campaigns about the value and importance of IP to the video game industry, and collaboration with Mexican government agencies   CIIPA International Intellectual Property Alliance® IIPA 2023 Special 301 Letter to USTR, January 30, 2023, page vi that work on IP matters. Work under the MOU has already begun, including an ESA-led training for over 60 members of the IMPI enforcement team. The Netherlands: The site-blocking mechanism in the Netherlands continued to improve in 2022. After the Association for the Protection of the Rights of the Entertainment Industry of the Netherlands (BREIN) secured a final blocking order of The Pirate Bay in 2020 following 11 years of proceedings, Dutch Internet service providers (ISPs) agreed in 2021 to a covenant whereby a court order for blocking an infringing website against one ISP will be executed voluntarily by the other ISPs. This agreement has been tested with the blocking of an additional six infringing sites (as well as hundreds of proxies) in 2022. Blocking is dynamic, enabling updates by BREIN without further court orders. Peru: Although Peru still has high levels of piracy, it has taken significant, positive steps to address this, notably thanks to the decisive role that continues to be played by the Instituto Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia y de la Protección de la Propiedad Intelectual (\"INDECOPI\") in issuing injunctions for ISPs to disable access to copyright infringing websites. For example, on June 2, 2022, INDECOPI issued the largest ex officio administrative blocking order against a total of 147 websites, including over 40 globally popular stream-ripping sites that were blocked by all ISPs. This unprecedented action was possible because of the close cooperation between INDECOPI and private sector organizations representing national and international rights holders in Peru. 10 Singapore: In October 2022, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Singapore Police conducted simultaneous enforcement actions at several retail shops, seizing 2,500 suspected illegal set-top-boxes. The Copyright Act in Singapore was amended recently to provide that those found to have infringed the Act by making, dealing, importing, distributing, or offering of devices or services to access works without the authority of copyright owners can be fined up to $100,000, imprisoned for up to five years, or both.11 Thailand: Although further improvements are still needed in Thailand's copyright framework as discussed in the Thailand Country Report, amendments to the Copyright Act that entered into force in August 2022 included some helpful improvements, including on secondary liability, the protection of technological protection measures (TPMs), and the reinstatement of a procedure for notice and takedown. There also have been some positive voluntary public/private sector initiatives in the form of Memorandums of Understandings in connection with \"Online Advertising and Intellectual Property Rights\" and \"Protection of IPR on the Internet\" devised by the Department of Intellectual Property, together with the Department of Business Development and Department of International Trade Promotion, respectively. Vietnam: In June 2022, the Cinema Law passed, allowing self-classification for films disseminated on the Internet, which includes most video-on-demand (VOD) content, and a grace period for implementation. Vietnam should maintain these positive changes in the related draft implementing decrees, while removing negative policies like the screen quota and discriminatory film fund. In June 2022, Vietnam also passed amendments to the IP Law, which will enter into force on January 1, 2023, following Vietnam's welcome accession to the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) in April 2022. The latest amendments contain improvements for rights holders, with an improved definition of the making available right, the illegal uploading and streaming of a cinematographic work categorized as a violation of communication rights, and the copying of part of a work considered as a reproduction, all of which create additional opportunities for rights holders to seek civil or criminal relief against online infringers. IIPA understands that implementing regulations are currently being drafted by the Copyright Office of Vietnam under the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism. This process offers an opportunity to further clarify and refine some important, 10 Illustrating the effectiveness of these website blocking actions, in November 2020, the most popular stream-ripping site in the country was Y2Mate, which received an average of 138,000 visits from Peru each day. The site was blocked by ISPs in the country in December 2020, and by March 2021, daily visits from Peru were down to just 22,000, a reduction of 84.1%. The blocking action of this single site continued to be effective and visits to the site did not exceed 15,000 per day during the first six months of 2022. Ten further stream-ripping sites were blocked in May 2021, and an even more positive effect was observed. By July 2021, traffic to the ten blocked sites was down by 88.4%. In June 2022, visits were 97.5% lower compared to the month before the blocking took place. These actions also had an impact on overall levels of stream ripping. Total visits to all stream-ripping sites were 22.9% lower in Q2 2022 than in Q4 2020 when Y2Mate became the first blocked stream-ripping site. 11 See Ang Qing, Sim Lim Square Shops Raided for Illegal Streaming Devices, 2,500 Sets Seized and 17 People Arrested, October 7, 2022,    C Ⓒ IIPA International Intellectual Property Alliance® IIPA 2023 Special 301 Letter to USTR, January 30, 2023, page vii outstanding elements of the law, and IIPA encourages the government to continue to incorporate feedback from rights holders to ensure a smooth implementation of the improved IP Law. IIPA welcomes these 2022 positive developments and looks forward to continuing to work with governments to foster a healthy ecosystem for the creative industries. Despite these positive developments, serious additional legal reform and enforcement issues remain in several of these countries. The details of these and other issues in certain of these countries can be found below and in the respective Country Reports in Appendix A. IV. ADDITIONAL CONCERNS IN OTHER KEY FOREIGN MARKETS B. As detailed in the Country Reports, there are several countries, notably South Africa, Canada, Ecuador, Indonesia, Nigeria, Peru, and Switzerland, where the press for reforms and modernization of national copyright laws have failed to keep pace with market and technological trends. In some cases, reform efforts have become a vehicle for proposals that threaten well-established global norms enshrined in long-standing international instruments, including by introducing broad exceptions and limitations. In addition to the problematic legal reform efforts identified in the Country Reports, the governments of several other countries, including Belgium, Germany, Kenya, Malaysia, Paraguay, Philippines, South Korea, and Turkey, have introduced legislation, recently enacted legislation, or taken other actions that threaten to significantly weaken, not strengthen, copyright protections or enforcement in those countries. Further details of the serious concerns in these markets are provided below. IIPA urges the U.S. government to monitor developments in these countries and proactively engage with these governments to ensure their legal reform efforts result in adequate and effective copyright protection and enforcement. A. Belgium In June 2022, Belgium enacted a law implementing the European Union (EU) Directive 2019/790 on copyright and related rights in the Digital Single Market (DSM Copyright Directive) that introduced an additional remuneration right (ARR) for uses covered by Article 17, and more broadly in the context of the implementation of Article 18, of the DSM Copyright Directive. The law was published on August 1, 2022, and entered into force on the same day. The introduction of ARR in Section 62 of the implementing law was proposed by the government without conducting consultations or any proper impact assessment of this issue. The new provision raises significant questions regarding its compliance with fundamental EU principles, including its impact on freedom of contract and freedom to conduct business, as well as regarding the practical application of the ARR and how the new legal regime should work (e.g., what is the impact on local and foreign rights holders and performers, how to ensure the correct distribution, to what time period should it apply, etc.). Germany The 2021 transposition of the DSM Copyright Directive into German legislation and the changes to Germany's Copyright Act introduced broad new exceptions for copyright protected works on online content-sharing service providers (OCSSPs). The new exceptions include an overbroad limitation on the exercise of exclusive rights for \"presumably permitted uses\" and content that is \"pre-flagged\" by users as non-infringing. Those presumably permitted uses apply to user-generated content that (1) contains less than half of a work by a third party or several works by third parties, (2) combines the work parts according to (1) with other content, and (3) makes only minor use of third-party works. Uses of up to 15 seconds each of a cinematographic work or motion picture, 15 seconds per soundtrack, 160 characters per text, and 125 kilobytes per photographic work are considered \"minor uses\" of a copyrighted work. These new de facto exceptions exceed the \"three-step test\" and will lead to an untenable situation in which certain uses would be permitted in Germany but not elsewhere in Europe or worldwide. ¹2 12 Article 13 of the WTO TRIPS Agreement obligates WTO members to \"confine limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights to certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder.\" See also Berne Convention Article 9(2)   CIIPA International Intellectual Property Alliance® IIPA 2023 Special 301 Letter to USTR, January 30, 2023, page viii In addition, the implementation of Article 17 introduces direct remuneration claims for authors and owners of certain related rights, subject to mandatory collective rights management. This means that creators who have licensed or transferred their rights to producers and already obtained remuneration under these contracts, would still be able to ask for a remuneration from an OCSSP. The direct remuneration claim would be unwaivable and administered only by collective management organizations (CMOS). These provisions raise significant questions regarding both their practical application, as well as their legitimacy, not least because they are unreasonable restrictions of the freedom of contract. C. Kenya While the Government of Kenya has indicated its intention to ratify the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WPPT (collectively, the WIPO Internet Treaties), it has yet to do so or to set a timeframe for accession. Kenya should ratify and implement the WIPO Internet Treaties as part of its ongoing Copyright Act amendment process. Kenya's 2019 amendment to the Copyright Act was intended to address some of the challenges of the digital age, but Kenya's copyright framework remains deficient in several significant respects. A 2020 draft Intellectual Property Bill (IP Bill), which largely incorporated 2019 amendments to the Copyright Act, failed to address many of these deficiencies and included additional provisions that fall short of Kenya's international obligations and best practices. To ensure its legal framework provides adequate and effective protection and enforcement of IP rights, Kenya's government should revise the IP Bill to address shortcomings in Kenya's copyright and enforcement framework, including by: deleting the provisions requiring copyright registration and compulsory recordation of assignments, and removing the requirement in the Copyright Act that authentication devices be affixed to sound recordings, all of which are incompatible with Kenya's international obligations, including under the Berne Convention and the WTO TRIPS Agreement, and with the requirements of the WPPT; ensuring that the exclusive rights of communication to the public and making available are clearly defined and meet the requirements of the WPPT; ensuring that exclusive rights apply to all sound recordings, including \"born digital\" recordings; retaining the rights of communication to the public and broadcasting as exclusive rights; providing adequate and effective protections for TPMs and rights management information (RMI), in line with international standards; providing a term of protection consistent with international norms (life of the author plus 70 years, or at least 70 years from fixation or publication for sound recordings or works not measured by the life of a natural person); expressly incorporating the three-step test into the law to properly confine the scope of exceptions and limitations to copyright protection; improving Kenya's online liability regime to ensure that it supports sustainable growth of the digital content markets and does not shield copyright infringing services, including by: (i) ensuring there is a clear legal basis under which ISPs may be held liable for IP infringements carried out by third parties using their services or networks; (ii) clarifying that safe harbors apply only to passive and neutral intermediaries that do not contribute to infringing activities; (iii) clarifying the responsibilities of ISPs eligible for safe harbors, including an obligation to remove infringing content expeditiously upon obtaining knowledge or awareness of the infringing activity and to take measures demonstrated effective in preventing or restraining infringement; (iv) requiring ISPs to implement effective repeat infringer policies; and (v) (same, as to reproduction right); WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) Article 10 (same, as to all Berne exclusive rights and all exclusive rights granted under the WCT itself); WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) Article 16(2) (same, as to all rights provided for under WPPT).   D. E. CIIPA International Intellectual Property Alliance® IIPA 2023 Special 301 Letter to USTR, January 30, 2023, page ix Malaysia Following a short consultation period in December 2021, Malaysia's new Copyright (Amendment) Act 2022 was adopted on February 10, 2022. The Act introduces new offenses for the unauthorized sharing of links to copyrighted works and for addressing streaming technologies that commit or facilitate copyright infringement in any work. However, the Act also provides for broad intervention in collective management from the \"Controller of Copyright\" (the Director General of the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia (MyIPO)) to issue guidelines on any matter relating to the declaration and operation of a CMO. New subsidiary regulations relating to collective management have since been introduced but these have not been substantive. Proposals have been made to introduce mandatory one- stop shop CMO licensing in Malaysia, interfering with rights holders' right to determine how and by whom their rights are managed. Unfortunately, the amendment did not change Malaysia's outdated term of protection for sound recordings and works, which should be extended to 70 years. Paraguay In August 2022, a problematic bill was introduced in the National Chamber of Deputies in Paraguay proposing a new remuneration right for musical and audiovisual performers to be paid by all digital platforms. The one-article bill establishes a 10% (default) statutory rate to be collected by banks and other financial institutions out of the subscribers' payments to premium accounts. The new right is subject to mandatory collective management, and the financial institutions must remit the proceeds to national CMOs. In certain respects, the proposal resembles a broad compulsory license that may apply even to unauthorized performances (i.e., piracy) and, as such, would be inconsistent with Paraguay's obligations under the WTO TRIPS Agreement. The proposal has no sound foundation (legal, economic, or otherwise), is unprecedented, and would significantly hinder the market for audiovisual works and recorded music in Paraguay. If enacted, the proposal would undermine the free exercise of exclusive rights and contractual freedom and would create chaos in the market because the scheme for administration is cumbersome and unnecessarily confusing involving multiple transactions, which will prove difficult, if not impossible, to follow. Philippines Online piracy is a major threat to the creative industries in the Philippines, and a more robust IPR enforcement regime is needed, including more timely investigations and prosecutions of online copyright theft. The Philippines have long been a primary source of camcord piracy of major motion pictures, and the government should remain vigilant on this issue. With the new Marcos government, an iteration of draft IP Code amendments has been introduced in Congress which would, for the first time in the Philippines, provide for an administrative no-fault injunctive remedy to disable access to infringing websites. IIPA encourages the government to enact this remedy to help rights holders protect their copyrights and combat online piracy. The remedy should not include a fiscal bond requirement, which is F. encouraging all ISPs, not only those that may avail themselves of safe harbors, to implement \"know-your- business-customer\" (KYBC) procedures. ensuring effective, transparent, and accountable collective management of rights consistent with international standards and best practices to ensure rights holders are able to control the use of their rights; introducing a rate-setting standard applicable to the licensing of collectively managed rights requiring that rates reflect the economic value of the use of the rights in trade (i.e., willing buyer/willing seller standard); providing deterrent civil and criminal penalties to combat piracy, including applying increased penalties for second and subsequent offenses and fines and imprisonment terms for criminal offenses to all offenses, including circumvention of TPMs, distribution of devices designed to circumvent TPMs, and removal/alteration of RMI; and clarifying the role of the proposed IP Tribunal.   ⒸIIPA International Intellectual Property Alliance IIPA 2023 Special 301 Letter to USTR, January 30, 2023, page x inapplicable to the online environment, and reasonable qualitative criteria should be applied (such as whether the site has the primary purpose or effect of infringing or facilitating infringement of copyright). Unfortunately, the draft legislation also retained several problematic provisions, which should be removed or revised as indicated below: G. Remove the extended collective licensing (ECL) mechanism in Section 204: ECL is a system that was developed for certain specific cases in markets with well-developed collective rights management systems, and with CMOs already representing a substantial number of rights holders in their respective fields. This is not the case in the Philippines. Furthermore, an ECL is a limitation on the exercise of rights and, as such, must comply with the three-step test. Accordingly, an ECL may be introduced only where there is a proven market failure and where individual licensing is unfeasible, not into a developed and well-functioning market. There is no evidence justifying the introduction of ECL in the Philippines, and the proposed ECL does not comply with the three-step test. At a minimum, if evidence justifying ECL for certain uses emerges, sufficient safeguards must be added to ensure compliance with the three-step test. Remove the provision for additional remuneration for performers for subsequent communications or broadcasts, which, like the ECL mechanism, interfere with freedom of contract and established contractual and licensing arrangements. Remove the open-ended fair use provision in Section 207 or at least change it to a closed-list fair dealing provision. Open-ended exceptions create unnecessary uncertainty, litigation, and conflicting decisions, causing confusion. Such exceptions can be harmful not only to rights holders but also to users who need certainty regarding which uses are permitted. Closed list systems have been adopted in most countries because they provide a high degree of certainty as to the permitted uses. Fair use is determined on a fact-intensive, case-by-case basis. In the United States, a well-developed body of case law helps to mitigate the inherent uncertainty of the scope of the fair use exception. Without this foundation of a well- developed body of case law, a fair use exception in the Philippines raises questions regarding the first requirement of the three-step test, that exceptions must be limited to \"certain special cases.\" Extend the term of protection for sound recordings and works: The term of protection should be extended to at least 70 years in keeping with the international standard, as discussed below. Clarify the requirements for mandatory accreditation of CMOs with Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) in Section 203.2: It should be made clear that individual rights holders, engaged in licensing of rights they own or control, shall not be under any obligation to seek an accreditation. Finally, the Philippines government should avoid any consideration of a screen quota in proposed legislative amendments and remove or dial back foreign ownership and investment restrictions, which limit the U.S. industries contribution to the growth of local creative economies. South Korea Several legislators in the National Assembly have proposed amendments to the South Korea's Copyright Act that contain problematic proposals, including to introduce a statutory remuneration right for directors and scriptwriters who have already assigned their rights, which would allow them to claim additional compensation from any profits generated. These proposals would undermine the freedom and sanctity of contracts and have a dramatic chilling effect on investment in the audiovisual industry. If enacted, producers of content will be faced with uncertainties regarding increased risks of unlimited liability for payouts of additional remuneration over an extended period of time. As a result, producers may reserve profits from popular, best-selling works to pay this additional remuneration to directors and scriptwriters, instead of re-investing the profits into the production of other, more niche content. This will ultimately harm the diversity and variety of content produced.   CIIPA International Intellectual Property Alliance® IIPA 2023 Special 301 Letter to USTR, January 30, 2023, page xi H. Turkey For over a decade, the Government of Turkey has promised to modernize its Copyright Law (1951, last amended in 2016) to fully implement the obligations of the WIPO Internet Treaties. Turkey acceded to the treaties in 2008, but has yet to fully implement them, including by providing proper remedies against the circumvention of TPMs and protecting RMI. In 2018, the Government of Turkey circulated a comprehensive Copyright Law reform bill (2018 Bill), but that draft was withdrawn in 2019, in large part because of disagreements about the provisions on CMOS. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism worked on a smaller package instead of the withdrawn 2018 Bill, but only Article 72 of the Copyright Law was amended to expand protections against circumventing TPMs. While secondary legislation was studied and changes were made in the CMO regulations and banderol regulations, these small changes will not bring the required solutions to many of the existing copyright problems as discussed below and, unfortunately, the needed changes are not expected to be made soon. Turkey's legal framework should be amended to address Turkey's digital piracy problem-including stream ripping, cyberlockers, BitTorrent and other peer-to-peer (P2P) linking sites, download sites, and \"topsites\" (i.e., high speed servers used covertly to share content) which is widespread and has stifled the legitimate market. While the current Copyright Law provides for a notice and takedown process, an ISP's failure to comply with takedown notices or requests to block access to infringing websites are merely subject to administrative fines. A rights holder must obtain a criminal court injunction to require the ISP to remove the infringing content. In addition, current law does not provide for criminal penalties for copyright violations. The Internet Law sets out broad liability exceptions that are inadequate to incentivize ISPs to address infringements on their sites or by those using their services. The law provides that service providers are not liable for third-party content unless \"it is clear that [the provider] adopts the content to which it provides a link and that the user intends to access that content.\" The definition of a provider is unclear, and should be clarified to define who is, and is not, eligible for the limitation on liability, and the liability limitation should apply only to passive and neutral intermediaries that do not contribute to infringing activities. Also, unlike most countries, including the United States, the liability exemption denies the ability of a rights holder to obtain injunctive relief. This also should be corrected. The governance and management of CMOs has been a long-standing problem in Turkey. Currently, foreign rights holders face discriminatory policies that prevent foreign producers from being fully participating members of Turkish CMOS (with full voting rights and management and decision-making authority). Because of this, the monetary distribution rules and practices are discriminatory to foreign rights holders, and there is no transparency for non- management rights holders. The prior drafts of CMO legislation (including the 2018 draft) would not have addressed the fundamental problem of banning non-Turkish producers from full participation in, or management of, the CMOS.

      "Text: See attached files    Historians Thoughts on the OSTP RFI for an AI National Strategy Jonathan Coopersmith jcoopersmithtamuedu organized this response which evolved from the contributions of Kathleen Comerford Georgia Southern  University Arthur Daemmrich Arizona State University Damayanthie Eluwawalage Delaware State University Dan Gorman University of Rochester Stephen Thomas Hatez Hatez Capital Sally Yi Princeton University and others Introduction Protecting rights safety and national security Advancing equity and strengthening civil rights Bolstering democracy and civic participation Promoting economic growth and good jobs Innovating in public services Preserving historical records and promoting good history  Introduction Artificial intelligence AI was not on Mel Kranzbergs mind in  when he declared Technology is neither good nor bad nor is it neutral But the cofounder of Society for the History of Technology SHOT clearly understood the uncertainty that accompanies the socially shaped evolutions of new technologies and technological systems They develop as part of the world that surrounds them both reflecting and animating our values decisions and power relations AI may be used for good and for bad The goal is to support the former and minimize and contain the latter AI is only a tool coders sellers of AI as a service and users retain ultimate responsibility Governments however can and should shape how technologies are developed deployed and used for the public good The big challenges for the US government will be to  ensure that AI helps not harms national security  encourage ethical and equitable experimentation and use of AI while strengthening prevention and resiliency against its inevitable criminal and other negative applications  avoid the kinds of discriminatory uses that we have seen with previous breakthrough technologies  provide supportive infrastructure    Other significant challenges include establishing how to collect and preserve the history of AIinfused products and harnessing AI to improve government functioning In the late th century AI developers and advocates generated earlier waves of enthusiasm followed by nuclear winters of disappointed expectations investors and promoters This time however is different Really Not only have some AI systems matured into practical use but AI has become a democratizing technology like the automobile in early th century America Although production of AI chatbots like Chat GPT is concentrated just like automobile manufacturing access is widely available to anyone with a computer access to the Internet and for GPT  a month Unlike the possibly apocryphal tale of JP Morgan wisely deciding to sell his stock holdings weeks before the  Great Depression when a shoeshine boy bragged about buying stock this present AI boom will continue as developers create more specialized chatbots that should increase accuracy and improve the providers economics while decreasing the cost of access to users A miniGPT will be able to handle many applications at a small fraction of the cost of GPT More importantly continuing advances in databases and the supporting computing technologies will also promote the development of increasingly more capable systems that will embed AI into a wider range of tools and applications If one phrase describes the promise and peril of AI it is intensification and diffusion Indeed OSTP should consider eliminating the word AI from policy planning and instead use more concrete terms such as software algorithm computational tools or machine learning The intelligence in AI is amorphic and misleading which can lead to incorrect assumptions about this technologys capabilities and may lead to misguided policies i What we call AI is an algorithm and thus is also prone to be biased The fact that it can learn does not change the fact that the architecture of the algorithm itself as well as the information it relies on is biased To mitigate the potential harms of biased algorithms we need to understand and document how these algorithms workii Regardless of what it is called the result is experimentation and application occurring simultaneously on a massive scale aided by extensive publicity hype and public discussion While predictions of apocalyptic destruction and technological utopias have dominated headlines and chyrons much of the actual excitement about AI comes from literally millions of explorations mostly for smallscale applications occurring around the worldiii Experimentation implies failure as well as success The US government should support this democratization of experimentation by encouraging its agencies and other users to report failures or keep public experience logs so others can learn from their successes and failuresiv Our country owes a great debt to lawyer Steven Schwartz who powerfully demonstrated AIs potential for making things up via hallucination bias By failing to check his AIgenerated footnotes before submitting    the filing to a federal court the lawyer publicly demonstrated the importance of verifying what AI chatbots producev  Protecting rights safety and national security AI is not the first significant emerging technology to provoke concerns about potential dangers as well as promising benefits as historians of nuclear energy and weapons biology nanotechnology and surveillance technology can attest vi Appropriately the Future of Life Institute named its  Asilomar AI Principles after the  conference calling for selfregulation of the promising  and potentially destructive  new technology of genetic recombinationvii Its important to acknowledge that the worst fears for none of these technologies have occurred  but their risks still exist  especially for Big Brother surveillance AI is correctly considered a critical advanced technology for national security viii and the Defense Departments DOD ethical principles of responsible equitable traceable reliable and governable use are admirable The key issues are determining what implementation means in real life educating DOD and other personnel and communicating DODs experience with other parts of the federal government allies and potential adversaries ix National security extends beyond the military to economic and political cooperation and competition The European Unions AI Act offers the United States an opportunity for thoughtful reflection and action that could create a worldwide framework for ethical AI that channels but does not constrain unduly its research and applications x International organizations like the World Trade Organization and World Customs Organization have studied the potential consequences of disruptive technologies including AIxi The US government should work with these and other international organizations to encourage ethical AI coordinating with broader Department of State and democracy initiatives Extending existing regulatory approaches may have the advantage of familiarity such as applying the concept of an Institutional Review Board approval for federally funded human subjects research to create a TechIRB Before adaptation of any existing system however proponents should understand its weaknesses as well as strengthsxii Just as the spread of the automobile was supported by federal and state funding of roads and the creation and enforcement of traffic rules so too should the federal government support and maintain supportive AI infrastructure Equally if not more germane because of their transnational nature is the preinternet regulation of radio and television before the internet by international as well as national organizationsxiii One major concern is upgrading federal state and local IT infrastructure to handle AI as well as other IT functions Planning and resources for future upgrading are essential as the public understands xiv The failure of Congress and presidents to provide the funding and mandate for the Internal Revenue    Service to keep its IT systems uptodate imposed huge human societal and financial costs on the United States xv Lesser consequences afflicted the Library of Congress when it proved unable to stay current with digital cataloguing xvi Q Software can be developed to calculate the real impact of environmentally oriented practices Algorithms can gather the necessary information to calculate and estimate the real impact of environmental actions so that we can determine what works Here as elsewhere privacy concerns must be addressed For example advances in environmental technology such as collecting and analyzing environmental DNA also advance the very real challenge of violating the privacy of people whose DNA is captured xvii  Advancing equity and strengthening civil rights Q The federal government can increase the equity potential for AI by making internet broadband service universal and affordable already a major goal of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Promoting proactive basic cybersecurity is another priority and important function of government Extending current regulatory approaches may have the advantage of familiarity such as creating a TechIRB based on the Institutional Review Board authorization needed for federally funded human subject research Before adaptation of existing systems however proponents should understand the weaknesses as well as strengthxviii That Wells College president Jonathan Gibralter used ChatGPT to craft a graduation speech this year even as the higher education world discussed ChatGPT’s serious potential for cheating, reflects the mix of promise and uncertainty that surrounds the rapidly evolving technology. xix How can AI be used to enhance learning? At a microlevel, AI can present a wide range of alternative hypotheses and scenarios, ranking the probability of these results. Encouraging the teaching of statistics should enlarge the number of Americans capable of meeting AI on its own terrain. More important is development of historical and critical thinking skills to enable students to figure out what's wrong with a generated essay. Using AI in higher education applications is not new; chatbots, for example, are commonplace on college websites and able to answer basic questions on admissions, financial aid and other topics. Leveraging AI as it continues to improve will not only enhance the quality of current offerings, such as chatbots, but also introduce new tools and applications such as virtual teaching assistants and multilingual assistance as well better access to student services.  4  Especially for underserved rural and urban areas, the federal government should provide schools, libraries and other centers of civic engagement with resources (including opportunities to learn from their peers) to enable them to participate fully in AI educational opportunities and experimentation. A big equity challenge will be encouraging applications where profitability is uncertain: Chatbots for medical transcription are already marketed; other areas are advancing more slowly if at all.xx Contemporary and historical analyzes of technologies like oxygen sensors and office temperature standards data analysis algorithms have revealed unexpected biases toward certain groups and norms.xxi Awareness of these problems should focus attention on ensuring AI algorithms are trained to accept all types of people (ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.) as equal and promote equity. A welltrained AI could hopefully make suggestions and decisions without these biases. Similarly, a poorly trained or deliberately biased AI could distort policy, opportunities, and results, just like other technologies. xxii Done well, AI can serve as a translator and enabler, just as automatic transmission allowed people the freedom to drive without investing the effort to learn how to shift manually – but also how video cameras and cellphones allowed people to easily create, distribute, and consume videos worldwide. Good AI could provide underserved communities with tools to battle obstacles, such as lack of access to the internet and lack of understanding of government procedures. One possible downside of AI-assisted form-filling is the lack of incentive for institutions to simplify application processes. Q10. According to ClearForce, AI can reduce veteran suicide by accessing research, analyzing databases, and identifying higher-risk veterans.xxiii This same approach can also assist disaster response and emergency management, to mention only a few of countless possible applications. xxiv Q11. Technological tools need to be incorporated into environmental policymaking. Digital technology itself has the potential to cut global emissions by 15%, according to the World Economic Forum. The digital economy, driven by a boom of internetbased economic activities, significantly reduced carbon emissions during the pandemic.xxv Simultaneously, a significant amount of digital technology, especially servers for cloud computing and chip production is very energy intensive and is physically located in the American West, drawing on limited water resources and having negative environmental impacts.  Promoting economic growth and good jobs Q19 5  Good regulation sets a foundational floor of desirable conduct, not a ceiling limiting innovation and application. The federal government can set an example by educating and learning from users creating rubrics of best and ethical practices for federal agencies and contractors establish widely representative bodies to offer policy guidance employ AI to improve government operations OSTP can promote ethical and effective practices within the federal government and encourage other levels of government, the private and non-profit sectors, and individuals to do so also. A starting point might be the 2021 Artificial  Intelligence: An Accountability Framework for Federal Agencies and Other Entities by the Government Accountability Office. That framework provides thoughtful structures for how local, state, and local governments can provide responsible AI governance, data creation and manipulation, performance, and monitoring.xxvi Building on that GAO report, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) should be charged with leading a broad based effort to establish national or international standards for AI. NIST should urge developers and service providers as well as major users to develop their own code of ethics and standards for using AI. An annual all-of-government conference on AI ethics and operations should keep federal policies current and responsive. Federal actions and support should encourage state and local governments to act similarly. Federal agencies should develop a basic rubric of questions for AI to reduce hallucination bias and maximize AI generative capabilities. This rubric should be revised as necessary. Possible questions include: -  Can you explain the criteria for the conclusions and sources? What are possible disadvantages? What else should be considered?  While cybersecurity is very important, putting AI federal oversight in a cybersecurity/defensive agency like the Department of Homeland Security might limit its constructive potential. An inter-agency council, like the National Space Council, might provide the best institutional approach to managing ongoing policy debate.  The initial reaction of many organizations to ban AI has changed to sensibly encouraging experimentation. Just as DARPA and NASA have used competitions and prizes to encourage innovation toward specific goals, so should OSTP encourage federal agencies and private and non-government organizations to sponsor similar challenges and share their lessons learned.xxvii For example, the National Endowment for the Humanities could ask how AI might help achieve the overarching goals of its Cultural and  6  Community Resilience program.xxviii Crucial to improving access would be  designing competitions to be inclusive of communities otherwise left out of the accelerating pace of AI use. DARPA, for example, often resources competing teams to level the playing field. An AI competition that provides small grants to local organizations to come up with uses that benefit their immediate community that are then part of a larger competition would help break through some of these barriers. Because the applications of AI will be so far-reaching and wide-ranging, policymakers should reach beyond people directly invested in its applications (like AI engineers and businesses) to seek broader and deeper input from humanistic scholars of technology as well as broader segments of society. Participatory Technology Assessment could be an effective tool for both reaching out to a broad spectrum of Americans and generating the deep understanding of AI applications that policymakers and observers would find useful.xxix We can expect people to employ AI/GPT to explore policy questions as well as more targeted, smaller issues. Governments should as a result expect a more informed, focused, and opinionated citizenry. One opportunity could be greater attention to internal workings of government agencies. Most AI uses will be small-scale and specific, developed to automate, accelerate, and improve daily business, administrative and private needs and desires. Q18 Like the mechanization of agriculture and decline of coal production, AI will affect jobs negatively and positively. To quote a recent phrase, “AI may not replace you, but a person who uses AI could.”xxx Studies of the future of work focus on five dimensions:xxxi Number of jobs Job quality Wage and income inequalities Social protection Social dialogue and industrial relations The most visible is job loss. Historically, the creative destruction of existing jobs by new technologies has often been wrenching and geographically concentrated. New jobs, sparked by new technologies ultimately appeared but those opportunities often were not immediate, not obvious, and not in the same geographic area. Reducing obstacles to job mobility and encouraging people to experiment should be a high priority for minimizing the immediate negative aspects of AI’s reshaping of employment. Q21 The alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea is a historical model for technology policy, cultural exchange, and international stability. Samsung  7  and Hyundai have done well in the United States. Could AI development and diffusion benefit from understanding how previous technological transfer succeeded and failed?xxxii Q27 Since the Wright brothers first flight over a century ago, aviation has developed, embraced and embedded many different technologies including Machine Learning with both positive and negative consequences, especially in flight/pilot training. Pilot training is primarily and ideally a human-to-human interaction. Therefore, trying to ‘push’ technology and forging it into human-machine interaction would not be prudent or practical. As Pilot Institute explains, “AI is such a powerful thing, more or less like a double-edged sword. AI adopted into aviation with improper safety protocols and certification procedures will do more harm than good. Hence, it is the responsibility of all the safety agencies, manufacturing organizations, operators, and contributors to contribute positively towards the adaptation of AI into the aviation industry.”xxxiii AI offers the opportunity to rethink pilot training with an emphasis on evidence-based, effective safety protocols and reducing openings for pilot errors. Q29 Preserving historical records and promoting good history You could add language about AI helping with digital finding aids. A good chatbot could help users to navigate through the Library of Congress catalog, the Smithsonian catalog, etc., to find sources. I see huge potential in AI helping researchers to navigate government collections faster. Missing from OSTP’s detailed questions is concern about preservation of historic records; how AI will affect archival content; how those who collect and preserve those records will determine what is created by humans versus that which is not; and ensure that archival content remains unchanged and accessible. OSTP should work with archivists, library professionals, historians, data scientists, and records managers to tackle the challenges of collecting, collating, and maintaining accurate archives in an age of easily generated and manipulated data. xxxiv Knowing how and by whom (or what) a document is created is essential not just to professional historians, but to every citizen concerned about the past – and the future. Issues about honesty, content, and conclusions are of great importance not only in the classroom, but also in the archive and wider public.  AI has the potential to disseminate the best historical scholarship with verifiable historical truth without political bias, deliberate misinformation, and political mandates. It equally has the potential to disseminate deliberate misinformation as historical fact. How can the former be encouraged and the latter blocked? The history profession and its supporting institutions encourage innovative work with AI like Princeton graduate student Jack Callaghan, who created an app that creates readable and searchable text output from digitized handwritten sources xxxv These discussions should also consider how AI can assist in research, examine and analyze texts and maps, and draw connections over wide periods of history and 8  locations. Work in the digital humanities has already been done on analyzing lost languages and damaged texts. In how many other ways can AI help? Archivists and historians are studying these issues. Since 2016, the IEEE Big Data conference has held workshops on Computational Archival Science. In 2019, a collaboration of librarians, archivists and other information preservers organized Responsible Operations “to help chart library community engagement with data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.” xxxvi A year later, University of Maryland professor Richard Marciano established the international Advanced Information Collaboratory (AIC) to examine the potential and ethics of “disruptive technologies for archives and records management (including CAS—Computational Archival Science, AI, ML, Digital Curation, etc.”xxxvii The American Historical Association (AHA) hosted a virtual session on the implications of AI for historical research in June, 2021, but no major effort of historians has yet emerged.xxxviii Historians and social scientists clearly will have a vital role in training AI to understand historical arguments and schools of thought. Someone without historical education should not be \"tasked\" with training AI that will, say, be used for classroom instruction or educational assistance. Such subject matter experts (SMEs) are crucial (along with promoting and exploring a diversity of thought) to create ethical and verifiable programs. Historians and other \"memory keepers\" exemplify why 1SMEs should be consulted at every step in generating AI-aided products and programs. SMEs provide the synthesis and deep knowledge that the current group of cheaply purchased contingent workers training AI algorithms cannot provide.  E.g., David J.

Among the U.S. pork industry’s top export markets are Canada and Mexico, both of which send livestock to the United States to be raised, slaughtered, and processed. U.S. pork producers, for example, purchased roughly 4.4 million weaner/feeder pigs from Canada for finishing in the United States in 2020, and American meatpackers bought an additional 800,000 Canadian pigs for processing in U.S. plants in the same year. (Weaners are about 8 weeks old; hogs reach market weight in about 6 months.) The pork industries in the United States, Canada, and Mexico are highly integrated as a result of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement and its successor, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), both of which eliminated tariffs on pork traded in North America. In 2022, Mexico was the No. 1 export destination for U.S. pork and Canada was No. 4. (Mexico was U.S. beef’s No. 4 export market and Canada was No. 5.) Any law, regulation, or administrative action that upsets that symbiotic relationship among the three countries likely would be challenged. That is what happened in December 2008, when Canada and Mexico initiated separate World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement cases against the United States over its Mandatory Country-of-Origin Labeling (MCOOL) rule. (The cases were combined in May 2010 because of the similarity of the claims.) Both countries stated they were not challenging MCOOL, as such, but were arguing that its requirements acted as protectionist trade barriers that distorted competition between imported and domestic meat products.  A major complaint involved the “Product of the United States” label for animals born, raised, and slaughtered in the United States. Canada and Mexico argued this unfairly denied the use of that label for products from animals that were exported to the United States at a young age and subsequently raised and slaughtered there. Mexico, for example, pointed out that 70 percent of the weight and value of its feeder cattle sent to the United States was added in the United States. After the WTO in 2012 ruled that MCOOL violated the international Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement and authorized Canada and Mexico to retaliate against more than $2 billion of U.S. goods, including pork, FSIS amended the MCOOL regulations in 2013, making the new rule, some argued, even more complicated. That, too, was challenged, and in late 2015, Congress repealed MCOOL for muscle cuts of pork and beef and ground pork and beef. (See attachment.) Now, FSIS proposes to again impose the born, raised, slaughtered – and processed – in the United States criteria for labels that bear the claim “Product of USA” or “Made in the USA.” Meat products from live animals imported into the United States for feeding or immediate slaughter no longer could make such a label claim. Minimally processed product could use a qualified U.S.- origin claim, such as “sliced and packaged in the United States using imported pork.” Rule Likely Violates WTO, USMCA Technical Barriers to Trade NPPC fails to see a distinction between the 2009 (original) or 2013 (amended) MCOOL rule and the proposed rule, which, while billed as voluntary, will have the effect of being mandatory since it will create a strong incentive for producers to prefer domestic animals to imported ones so they can use the “Product of USA” and “Made in the USA” claims. The use of labels to identify the origin of meat and meat products is a normal condition of competition; therefore, to compete effectively, producers must use such labels. That would have a detrimental impact on imports of live animals, potentially triggering U.S. trading partners, specifically Canada and Mexico, to challenge the rule under the WTO’s Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement or the USMCA’s chapter on technical barriers, according to an analysis of the FSIS proposal conducted for NPPC. To be legal under WTO or USMCA, technical trade regulations must treat imported products as favorably as “like” products of national origin. But the proposed rule is not even-handed in its treatment of animals born, raised, slaughtered, and processed in the United States compared with those imported into the United States and slaughtered and processed here. If the rule were challenged by Canada and/or Mexico at the WTO or through USMCA and found to be inconsistent with U.S. obligations under the technical barriers provisions, there would be a risk of retaliation against U.S. pork (among other agricultural and non-agricultural products) unless the United States resolved the inconsistency. The loss of the Mexican and Canadian pork markets, which in 2022 took $2.9 billion of U.S. pork, would result in the loss of thousands of agricultural and non-farm jobs. Economist Dermot Hayes, with Iowa  State University, a decade ago estimated the effect of Canada’s and Mexico’s $2 billion in retaliation would cost the United States 17,000 jobs. Proof that retaliation is no idle threat is Mexico’s March 2009 imposition of tariffs ranging from 5-25 percent on 89 U.S. products, including apples, pork, and wine, valued at $2.4 billion. A NAFTA dispute panel approved the retaliation in response to the United States canceling a cross-border trucking program. Particularly hard hit was the U.S. potato industry, which saw immediate losses in market share in Mexico, with Canadian potato farmers filling the void, and plummeting prices for U.S. growers. The retaliation ended in July 2011. Other Problems with Product of U.S. Label Beyond the speculative but highly probable retaliatory tariffs from Canada and Mexico, there are more concrete reasons to jettison or completely rewrite the proposed labeling rule. Like its mandatory predecessor, the amended “Product of USA” imparts no useful health or safety information to consumers, and no health or safety rationale has been advanced by USDA, because there is none. Imported meat products are already subject to the same strict sanitary requirements that are applied to domestically produced meat and must be labeled as “imported.” Live animals must pass veterinary inspections before being allowed into the United States. The proposed rule also would not be effective in educating consumers about the country of origin of meat or processed products. USDA’s own 2022 survey revealed 47 percent of participants incorrectly supposed the current “Product of USA” claim on labels means meat came from animals born, raised, slaughtered, and processed in the United States. In fact, only 16 percent of consumers identified the correct definition for the “Product of USA” labeling claim, and another 21 percent did not know the meaning of the claim. These findings suggest that even if the proposed rule is adopted and the “Product of USA” label only used meat derived from animals born in the United States, more than 50 percent of U.S. consumers still will not know the meaning of the label. Given that, and the fact that at best only 31 percent of the same survey’s respondents even noticed the “Product of USA” label, it seems unlikely the rule will fulfill its stated objectives of resolving consumer confusion surrounding current voluntary label claims and ensuring consumers understand where their food comes from. That is consistent with USDA’s 2015 analysis of MCOOL, which found “there was little to no evidence of a measurable increase in consumer demand for beef or pork as a result of COOL requirements” and “little evidence that consumers would be likely to increase their purchases of food items bearing U.S.origin labels.” Similarly, a 2013 analysis found “no identifiable increase in demand,” suggesting that implementation of the 2009 MCOOL resulted in a net economic welfare loss. Said the study’s authors, “Our findings are in line with a variety of studies suggesting MCOOL impacts are unlikely to be significant.”  Pointedly, country of origin just isn’t that important to most consumers. According to Kansas State University College of Agriculture’s “Meat Demand Monitor,” in a ranking of 12 factors consumers use in purchasing meat, product origin is No. 11, ahead only of “environmental impact.” (The most important factors are taste, freshness, safety, and price.) Additionally, “Product of USA” would impose costs on processors that undoubtedly would be passed onto consumers, and there would be additional costs associated with the record-keeping the proposed rule would require from entities using “Product of USA” or “Made in the USA” labels. Nearly 15 years ago, USDA’s regulatory impact analysis estimated the initial cost of complying with the 2009 MCOOL at $2.6 billion for all covered commodities, with subsequent annual costs of about $300,000 for livestock producers, wholesalers and processors, and retailers combined. Even the amended rule would have cost the pork, beef, and poultry industries between $53 million and $192 million in adjustment costs, according to USDA’s 2015 economic analysis. Additional discounted economic welfare losses over the first 10 years of the 2013 rule would have been $494 million for the beef industry and $403 million for the pork industry. Another, significant expense for the pork and beef industries would be segregating animals not born in the United States but imported here, the meat from which under the proposed rule could not be labeled as “Product of USA” or “Made in the USA.” For many pork producers in the upper Midwest who import feeder pigs from Canada, this makes no sense. (As previously mentioned, 4.4 million Canadian feeder pigs were imported into the United States in 2020; about a million beef cattle move from Mexico to U.S. feed lots annually.) Pork producers buy animals to fill out their finishing barns, ensuring they have full loads to go to the packing plant and meeting their contractual obligations to packers. Under the proposed rule, though, “Canadian” pigs would need to be segregated in barns, on trucks taking them to the packing plant, in the lairage of the plant, and in the processing line. During the time the 2009 MCOOL rule was in effect, some pork packing plants would process Canadian-born pigs only on designated days. This also required shutting down processing lines for some period, and it meant packers were discounting pigs from Canada. Some packers refused to take Canadian-born hogs. Furthermore, meat bound for export must be labeled Product of the USA under current regulations. Changing the labeling rule also would require segregation of finished products from live animals imported into the United States, and those products could not be exported from the United States. Again, the proposed rule would treat meat from foreign-born animals less favorably than meat from domestic animals and likely would have a detrimental effect on the trade and prices of foreign-born animals. A 2011 study from a graduate student at Texas A&M University found that MCOOL reduced the trade of live hogs between the United States and Canada by nearly 38 percent, with trade in feeder pigs reduced by more than 24 percent. (No doubt this is why Canada filed its WTO dispute.)  The irony for Canadian feeder pigs is that once on a U.S. farm, those 8-week-old animals spend about four months, or two-thirds of their life, eating U.S.-grown corn and soybean meal to reach market weight – around 285 lbs. – before being harvested in a USDA-inspected packing plant. How are they not a “Product of USA”? At least one commenter has pointed out that the proposed rule is necessary to comply with the Tariff Act, which requires country-of-origin labeling on imported meat unless a domestic entity “transforms it into a product with different characteristics and uses.” Currently, while imported meat must show the country of origin, meat from live animals exported to the United States, which undergo a substantial transformation, does not. Indeed, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) rulings specifically addressing the origin of meat establish that harvesting an animal is a substantial transformation that confers origin on the carcass. Additionally, relevant international norms designate origin based on harvest. Codex Standard 1-1985, General Standard for the Labeling of Pre-Packaged Foods, prescribes that processing confers origin if it changes the “nature” of the product. This is essentially the same as CBP’s substantial transformation standard where harvest confers origin. The existing rule for voluntary labeling reflects the results of the “substantial transformation” test, which allows a U.S. country of origin label for meat products made from an animal born, raised, slaughtered, and processed in the United States and a meat product made from an imported animal that is slaughtered and processed in the United States. Under the proposed rule, though, only meat from animals born, raised, slaughtered, and processed in the United States could be labeled “Product of USA” or “Made in the USA.” Animals born outside the United States, then imported here would require segregation throughout production chain, with accompanying increased costs of handling. The change in the conditions of competition for foreign-born animals that FSIS’s proposed rule would bring about thus distinguishes it from Canadian and Mexican guidelines, discriminates against imports, and, therefore, violates the WTO’s Article 2.1, Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement. Conclusion The proposed “Product of USA” rule would significantly increase costs for livestock producers at a time when they are struggling economically. The added costs of segregating animals and maintaining records to demonstrate compliance with the rule would do little, if anything, to address consumer confusion about the origin of products. Indeed, the one certain outcome for consumers would be increased prices to feed their families, price hikes that many American families cannot afford. Finally, the regulation would strain the relationships between the United States and its trading partners, particularly Canada and Mexico, and likely result in formal WTO and USMCA disputes being filed against the United States, with a possibility of tariff retaliation against U.S. goods, particularly agricultural products.  For the reasons cited, NPPC requests that USDA not move forward with the amended “Product of USA” rule as proposed. Respectfully submitted,  Bryan Humphreys CEO National Pork Producers Council  WTO Summary of Key Findings of the Dispute Settlement Panel, the Appellate Body and the Compliance Panel Summary of key findings of the initial dispute settlement panel report, November 18, 2011: This dispute concerns: (i) the U.S. statutory provisions and implementing regulations setting out the United States mandatory country of origin labeling regime for beef and pork (“COOL measure”); as well as (ii) a letter issued by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack on the implementation of the COOL measure (“Vilsack letter”). The Panel determined that the COOL measure is a technical regulation under the TBT Agreement and that it is inconsistent with the United States’ WTO obligations. In particular, the Panel found that the COOL measure violates Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement by according less favorable treatment to imported Canadian cattle and hogs than to like domestic products. The Panel also found that the COOL measure does not fulfill its legitimate objective of providing consumers with information on origin, and therefore violates Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement. As regards the Vilsack letter, the Panel found that the letter's “suggestions for voluntary action” went beyond certain obligations under the COOL measure and that the letter, therefore, constitutes unreasonable administration of the COOL measure in violation of Article X:3(a) of the GATT 1994. The Panel refrained from reviewing the Vilsack letter under the TBT Agreement, as it found that this letter is not a technical regulation under that agreement. In light of the above findings of violation, the Panel did not consider it necessary to rule on the claims under Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 (national treatment) or on the non-violation claims under Article XXIII:1(b) of the GATT 1994. Summary of key findings of the Appellate Body Regarding the U.S Appeal of the Panel Report: The appeal concerned primarily the COOL measure (the US statutory provisions and implementing regulations setting out the United States’ mandatory country of origin labeling regime for beef and pork), and the Panel’s findings that this measure is inconsistent with Articles 2.1 and 2.2 of the TBT Agreement. The United States appealed both findings. Canada appealed certain aspects of the Panel's analysis under Article 2.2 and requested the Appellate Body to complete the legal analysis in the event that it reversed the Panel’s finding under Article 2.2. Canada also raised conditional appeals with respect to the COOL measure under Articles III:4 and XXIII:1(b) of the GATT 1994. Although Canada originally also sought to have the Appellate Body make certain rulings with respect to the Vilsack letter, it withdrew the requests following the assertion by the United States that the measure had been withdrawn. The Appellate Body upheld, albeit for different reasons, the Panel’s finding that the COOL measure violates Article of the TBT Agreement by according less favorable treatment to imported Canadian cattle and hogs than to like domestic cattle and hogs. The Appellate Body reversed the Panel’s finding that the COOL measure violates Article of the TBT Agreement because it does not fulfill its legitimate objective of providing consumers with information on origin, and was unable to complete the legal analysis and determine whether the COOL measure is more trade restrictive than necessary to meet its objective. In its analysis under Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement, the Appellate Body agreed with the Panel that the COOL measure has a detrimental impact on imported livestock because its recordkeeping and verification requirements create an incentive for processors to use exclusively domestic livestock and a disincentive against using like  imported livestock. The Appellate Body found, however, that the Panel's analysis was incomplete because the Panel did not go on to consider whether this de facto detrimental impact stems exclusively from a legitimate regulatory distinction, in which case it would not violate Article 2.1. In its own analysis, the Appellate Body found that the COOL measure lacks even-handedness because its recordkeeping and verification requirements impose a disproportionate burden on upstream producers and processors of livestock as compared to the information conveyed to consumers through the mandatory labeling requirements for meat sold at the retail level. That is, although a large amount of information must be tracked and transmitted by upstream producers for purposes of providing consumers with information on origin, only a small amount of this information is actually communicated to consumers in an understandable or accurate manner, including because a considerable proportion of meat sold in the United States is not subject to the COOL measure’s labeling requirements at all. Accordingly, the detrimental impact on imported livestock cannot be said to stem exclusively from a legitimate regulatory distinction and instead reflects discrimination in violation of Article 2.1. For these reasons, the Appellate Body upheld the Panel's finding under Article 2.1. In its analysis under Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement, the Appellate Body found that the Panel properly identified the objective of the COOL measure as being “to provide consumer information on origin” and did not err in concluding that this is a “legitimate” objective. The Appellate Body found, however, that the Panel erred in its interpretation and application of Article 2.2. This was because the Panel appeared to have considered, incorrectly, that a measure could be consistent with Article 2.2 only if it fulfilled its objective completely or exceeded some minimum level of fulfillment, and to have ignored its own findings, which demonstrated that the COOL measure does contribute, at least to some extent, to achieving its objective. The Appellate Body, therefore, reversed the Panel’s finding that the COOL measure is inconsistent with Article 2.2 but was unable to determine whether the COOL measure is more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective within the meaning of Article 2.2. As the conditions on which Canada’s appeals with respect to Articles III:4 and XXIII:1(b) of the GATT 1994 were made were not satisfied, the Appellate Body made no findings under these provisions. At its meeting on 23 July 2012, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body report. Findings of the Compliance Panel with Respect to the Challenge by Canada and Mexico that the Revised U.S, Cool Regulation Complies with the Dispute Settlement Body Recommendations: The compliance panel found that the amended COOL measure violates Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement because it accords to Canadian and Mexican livestock less favorable treatment than that accorded to like U.S. livestock. In particular, the compliance panel concluded that the amended COOL measure increases the original COOL measure’s detrimental impact on the competitive opportunities of imported livestock in the U.S. market because it necessitates increased segregation of meat and livestock according to origin; entails a higher recordkeeping burden; and increases the original COOL measure's incentive to choose domestic over imported livestock. Further, the compliance panel found that the detrimental impact caused by the amended COOL measure does not stem exclusively from legitimate regulatory distinctions. In this regard, the compliance panel followed the approach of the Appellate Body in the original dispute by taking into account the amended COOL measure's increased recordkeeping burden, new potential for label inaccuracy, and continued exemption of a large proportion of relevant products. These considerations confirmed that, as with the original COOL measure, the detrimental impact caused by the amended COOL measure's labeling and recordkeeping rules could not be explained by the need to convey to consumers information regarding the countries where livestock were born, raised, and slaughtered.  The compliance panel determined the complainants had not made a prima facie case that the amended COOL measure is more trade restrictive than necessary within the meaning of Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement. In reaching this conclusion, the compliance panel found that the amended COOL measure makes a considerable but, given the exemptions from coverage, necessarily partial contribution to its objective of providing consumer information on origin. The compliance panel further found that the amended COOL measure had increased the “considerable degree of trade-restrictiveness” found in the original dispute. The compliance panel also assessed the risks non-fulfillment of the objective would create in terms of consumer interest in, and willingness to pay for, different types of countryof-origin information. Additionally, the compliance panel reviewed four alternative measures proposed by the complainants and concluded that either they would not make an equivalent contribution to the relevant objective as the amended COOL measure would, or they were not adequately identified so as to enable meaningful comparison with the amended COOL measure. As a result, the compliance panel was not able to conclude that the amended COOL measure is more trade restrictive than necessary in light of the proposed alternative measures. The compliance panel found that the amended COOL measure violates Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 based on its finding that the amended COOL measure increases the original COOL measure’s detrimental impact on the competitive opportunities of imported livestock in comparison with like U.S. products. In this regard, the compliance panel relied on the same considerations that informed its finding of detrimental impact under Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement. However, consistent with Appellate Body jurisprudence, it was not necessary in order to find a violation under Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 for the compliance panel to determine whether the detrimental impact stemmed exclusively from legitimate regulatory distinctions.

Washington, DC 2050 Dear Ms. Buffo: Re: 2024 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers This document is in response to the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) request for assistance in identifying significant barriers to U.S. exports for inclusion in the 2024 National Trade Estimate Report (Docket ID USTR-2023-0010) The U.S. Hop Industry Plant Protection Committee (USHIPPC) is pleased to submit the following significant trade barriers regarding U.S. hop exports (HS 1210.10, HS 1210.20, and HS 1302.13) to Canada, China, the European Union, Hong Kong, India, and the United Kingdom. USHIPPC provides oversight and coordination of hop industry plant protection research and pesticide registration efforts. USHIPPC also works to assist the industry with pesticide regulatory issues in foreign markets to facilitate international hop trade. Nearly fifty percent of U.S. hop production is exported to countries around the world. In 2022, the total value of hop products exported by the U.S. was approximately $486 million dollars. Despite an active trade policy program designed to eliminate trade barriers in foreign markets, a number of significant obstacles remain, and more are added each year. These trade restrictions adversely affect hop exports. The following information details the most significant of these barriers to the export of U.S. hops. USHIPPC respectfully requests that the information in this document be considered for inclusion in the final report published by USTR. Thank you for your consideration of these comments. Please contact me if you have any questions regarding this information. Sincerely,  Jessica Stevens Executive Director  CHINA Import Policies Tariffs on U.S. Hops China continues to apply retaliatory tariffs on U.S. hops in response to the U.S. Section 301 technology tariffs. The current tariff situation for U.S. hops is shown below. These tariffs harm U.S. hop exports to China and place the industry at a competitive disadvantage compared to suppliers in Europe that continue to export to China at China’s lower Most Favored Nation rate. HS Code  1210.10 1210.20 1302.13  Description  Hops, neither ground nor powdered nor in the form of pellets Ground, powdered or in the form of pellets; lupulin Hop Extract  China China Section Total China Tariff MFN Rate 301 Retaliatory on U.S. Hops Tariffs 20%  5%  25%  10%  10%  20%  10%  12.5%  22.5%  The U.S. hop industry appreciates the objective of ensuring China upholds it international obligations with respect to trade. However, a more targeted approach that avoids retaliatory tariffs on unrelated sectors such as agriculture must be secured. The U.S. hop industry urges further dialogue between the U.S. and China to ensure China’s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, including hops, are removed as soon as possible. Away from China’s retaliatory action, it is clear that China has failed to uphold the accession commitments it made to the World Trade Organization upon entry. As committed, China’s tariff reductions should have led an average Chinese MFN tariff below 10 percent by 2005. However, these tariffs remain at levels of 10-20 percent. The USHIPPC asks that USTR continue to hold China to account for these WTO commitments and seek the reduction of China’s prohibitively high MFN tariffs on hops. Decree 248 and 249 On January 1, 2022, China implemented Decree 248, a broad regulation that imposed new registration and labeling requirements for manufacturers supplying food products to China. Decree 248 requires overseas food manufacturers and storage facilities to register with Chinese authorities and to label a new registration number on the inner and outer packaging of foods manufactured and exported to China after January 1, 2022. This includes hops. China’s Decree 248 and Decree 249 requirements contravene China’s obligations as a WTO member to ensure measures introduced are least trade restrictive. Moreover, the requirements have resulted in additional bureaucracy and cost for suppliers to the market and present an  ongoing risk given China has the potential to alter the scope of the requirements at any time. This is not conductive to trade. The USHIPPC asks that USTR continue to counter Chinese regulatory requirements, including Decree 248, that impose unnecessary restrictions on trade. Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) There is currently no system in China to allow foreign industries to seek import tolerances in China. All MRLs in China must go through a full registration process including field trials in China. This is not feasible. A Chinese import tolerance system was expected to be announced in the first quarter of 2021, but the pandemic and disagreements on jurisdiction within China have delayed finalization. The U.S. hop industry requests that the USTR and other U.S. government agencies continue to support China’s establishment of an import tolerance system and encourage China to harmonize new MRLs with U.S. levels, or at least Codex MRLs, when establishing national Chinese MRLs. The U.S. hop industry also asks that the U.S. government cooperate with the Chinese government to ensure Chinese food import and MRL policies are transparent, consistently applied, based on sound science, and as least trade restrictive as possible. Estimate of Potential Increase in Exports if Barriers Were Removed In 2022, the U.S. exported $31 million worth of hop products to China. With tariffs reduced and the necessary MRLs established, U.S. hop exports to China would likely increase by a range of $5 to $25 million dollars. This estimate is based on industry projections, the current trajectory of export growth, and the nature of current trade impediments.

Washington, DC 2050 Dear Ms. Buffo: Re: 2024 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers This document is in response to the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) request for assistance in identifying significant barriers to U.S. exports for inclusion in the 2024 National Trade Estimate Report (Docket ID USTR-2023-0010) The U.S. Hop Industry Plant Protection Committee (USHIPPC) is pleased to submit the following significant trade barriers regarding U.S. hop exports (HS 1210.10, HS 1210.20, and HS 1302.13) to Canada, China, the European Union, Hong Kong, India, and the United Kingdom. USHIPPC provides oversight and coordination of hop industry plant protection research and pesticide registration efforts. USHIPPC also works to assist the industry with pesticide regulatory issues in foreign markets to facilitate international hop trade. Nearly fifty percent of U.S. hop production is exported to countries around the world. In 2022, the total value of hop products exported by the U.S. was approximately $486 million dollars. Despite an active trade policy program designed to eliminate trade barriers in foreign markets, a number of significant obstacles remain, and more are added each year. These trade restrictions adversely affect hop exports. The following information details the most significant of these barriers to the export of U.S. hops. USHIPPC respectfully requests that the information in this document be considered for inclusion in the final report published by USTR. Thank you for your consideration of these comments. Please contact me if you have any questions regarding this information. Sincerely,  Jessica Stevens Executive Director  THE EUROPEAN UNION Unwarranted Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures Speed and Cost of Maximum Residue Level Establishment The European Union (EU) maximum residue level (MRL) application system may require information that is not generated in the U.S. for domestic MRLs, such as metabolite data. The cost to obtain the required information can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single MRL. Consequently, it is often unaffordable to seek EU MRL import tolerances or adjustments to MRLs. The hop industry respectfully requests that the USTR advocate the streamlining of the MRL import tolerance establishment system with officials in the EU. Systematic Lowering of Maximum Residue Levels The EU maintains its MRLs under Regulation 396/2005. Article 12 of this regulation provides for a review by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) of the existing MRLs for all substances approved as active substances in plant protection products, and for substances non-approved on or after 2 September 2008. According to the EU, for each active substance, one member State of the European Union is designated as 'Rapporteur member State' (RMS). The RMS carries out the first evaluation of the existing EU pesticide MRL and prepares an evaluation report recommending its amendment if necessary. Subsequently, the scientific risk assessment body of the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), is charged with delivering a reasoned opinion on each substance, based on the evaluation report prepared by the RMS. In the reasoned opinion, if available, Codex Maximum Residue Limits (CXLs) are considered. However, the EU fails to consider the importance of the active ingredient’s MRL for trade facilitation purposes. Hundreds of EU MRLs have been amended to the default level of 0.01 ppm or to the lowest limit of quantification (LOQ), including MRLs that are important to U.S. hops exporters, even when comments have been submitted through the World Trade Organization (WTO) to keep the MRL so trade will not be affected. The U.S. hop industry believes that these priority MRLs, which are required for trade with the EU, have at times not been considered by member states in their evaluations and comments submitted via WTO were too late in the process to effect any change. To address concerns raised by interested stakeholders, EFSA now publishes the progress report for the Article 12 MRL review, which includes the anticipated start of data collection and the adoption of the EFSA Reasoned Opinion. That allows interested stakeholders to provide information to the European Rapporteur Member State at the beginning of the review process instead of only raising concerns at the WTO comment period. However, the publication of updates to EFSA’s progress has not been done quarterly as expected and that impacts the time stakeholders have to prepare the information needed for the review. The U.S. hop industry welcomes efforts by the EU to increase transparency. However, participation within the EU regulatory review process is still burdensome, requiring a significant degree of data analysis and time to determine who to contact, either within the member state or the registrant working on a submission. The U.S. hop industry asks that the U.S. government continue to work with officials in the EU to push for a more effective, transparent, and inclusive regulatory review process.  When a MRL is restricted, the EU generally allows for a six-month transition time before the new MRL enters into force. However, for products with a long shelf life, such as dried fruits, nuts, and hops, six months is often not enough time for the products to have been harvested, processed, sold, and consumed. Such products remain in the channels of trade for a period longer than the usual six months granted by EU authorities. To address this concern, the EU will sometimes allow the “old MRL” to continue to apply to products that have been produced in or imported into the EU before the new MRL became effective. That is done by including the following language to the MRL implementing regulation: “Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 as it stood before being amended by this Regulation shall continue to apply to products which were produced in the Union or imported into the Union before [Office of Publication: please insert date 6 months after entry into force] …” The language above, however, does not provide third countries with the same national treatment when it comes to MRLs, as there is a difference in the MRL application date for EU and foreign products. In addition, the EU has not been consistent in the inclusion of this language in recent implementing regulations, further increasing MRL regulatory uncertainty. This is a major concern for the U.S. hop industry, as hops have a long shelf life, and are usually stored for years before they are marketed or used in final products. In 2023, the U.S. hop industry has faced issues with the lack of consistent cannels of trade language in the EU’s MRL regulations. The U.S. hop industry respectfully requests that the U.S. government continues to engage with EU officials to establish a more consistent, transparent, and inclusive channels of trade policy similar to that the United States. Crops that have been legally treated prior to the MRL change should be able to enter and remain in the market even after the new MRL becomes effective. Pesticide Reviews The EU’s Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, concerning the placing of plant protection products in the EU market uses a hazard-based approach to pesticide review. Active ingredients may not fall under certain criteria to be approved in the EU. The criteria may be based on health concerns (mutagenic, carcinogenic, toxic for reproduction, or endocrine disruptor) or environmental concerns (persistent organic pollutant, persistent bioaccumulative and toxic, very persistent, and very bioaccumulative, among others). If the active ingredient is classified or has the potential to cause concerns, the EU does not carry out a risk assessment, considering exposure on the chemical. Once approval has been withdrawn, associated MRLs are also being withdrawn. There are fundamental concerns about the EU policy relying on hazard rather than conducting a complete risk assessment as determined by the World Trade Organization and Codex Alimentarius. The concern with the EU pesticide review methodology is relevant for non-EU stakeholders because once a substance is no longer approved for use in the EU, its corresponding MRLs are likely to be restricted as well. According to the EU Early Alert – Pesticide Review, between 2018 and September 2023, 89 substances of interest to U.S. growers had their approval expired, denied or restricted in their European review. Over the same period, 33 substances of interest to U.S. growers had their EU MRLs restricted due to their non approval status in the EU. There are additional substances for which their MRL restriction have been proposed but not yet notified to the WTO and are likely to be implemented within the next year. Of the proposed MRL restrictions, we call attention to the EU’s proposal to withdraw MRLs for clothianidin and thiamethoxam, two neonicotinoids that have been reviewed and approved by EPA for use in the United States, based  on European “global environmental concerns”. This proposal is an example of European efforts to apply EU health and environmental standards to imported foods. According to the European Commission’s report on the application of EU health and environmental standards to imported and agricultural and agri-food products published in June 2022, environmental factors will be considered in the process of setting not only EU MRLs, but also import tolerance requests. This includes import tolerances applications for pesticides that are no longer allowed in the EU. It is imperative that the European Union be challenged in its resolve to impose its policies on countries outside the European Union. The U.S. hop industry respectfully asks that USTR reviews whether the EU policies being put forward are consistent with their international obligations under WTO law. Estimate of Potential Increase in Exports if Barriers Were Removed In 2022, the U.S. exported approximately $171 million worth of hop products to the European Union (EU-27). Ensuring the EU MRL policies do not disrupt or restrict trade is critical to maintaining the growth of exports to this important market.

Sincerely,  Jessica Stevens Executive Director  HONG KONG Unwarranted Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures Maximum Residue Levels On August 1, 2014, Hong Kong implemented a new MRL regulation and no longer defers to Codex MRLs. Under the system, only established MRLs on the list apply. There are over 50 hop MRLs in place in Hong Kong, which is welcoming news. Despite this process, additional hop MRLs are needed. Due to political challenges involving China and Hong Kong in the Hong Kong Parliament, no new MRLs have been established since Hong Kong’s initial transition to the new MRL regulation. As more MRLs are established in the U.S. and set at Codex, the U.S. hop industry requests that the U.S. government seek clarification from Hong Kong regarding the potential inclusion of new MRLs. Hong Kong’s MRL list should be updated and include Codex MRLs when possible. Estimate of Potential Increase in Exports if Barriers Were Removed In 2022, the U.S. exported approximately $6.7 million worth of hop products to Hong Kong. U.S. hop exports to Hong Kong would likely increase by a range of less than $5 million dollars if the necessary MRLs are established. This estimate is based off industry projections, the current trajectory of export growth, and market conditions.

Sincerely,  Jessica Stevens Executive Director  INDIA Import Policies Tariffs on U.S. Hops India imposes high tariffs on U.S. hops of 30 percent, as shown in the table below. These tariffs are high and constrain exports to the market. HS Code 1210.10 1210.20 1302.13  Description  India MFN Tariff Rate (applicable to U.S.) Hops, neither ground nor powdered nor in the form 30% of pellets Ground, powdered or in the form of pellets; lupulin 30% Hop Extract 30%  The USHIPPC urges USTR to pursue the elimination of India’s tariffs on hops through the U.S.India Trade Policy Forum, through discussions parallel to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, or any alternative forum. As a World Trade Organization member, and close trading partner, it is important that India maintains a tariff schedule that is trade facilitative. This is not the case at present. Estimate of Potential Increase in Exports if Barriers Were Removed India is a potentially significant growth market for U.S. hop exports. In 2021, exports were valued at $750,000. In 2022, this figure had increased to $2.1 million. With the restriction removed, exports of U.S hops to India could reach more than $5 over the next five years and more than $30 million by the end of the decade. This estimate is based on industry projections and an assessment of market potential.

Sincerely,  Jessica Stevens Executive Director  UNITED KINGDOM Import Policies Tariffs on U.S. Hops The United Kingdom imposes tariffs of 4 percent on most imports of U.S. hops, as shown in the table below.  HS Code 12101000 12102010 12102090 13021300  Description Hop cones, fresh or dried (excl. ground, powdered or in the form of pellets) Hop cones, ground, powdered or in the form of pellets, with higher lupulin content; lupulin Hop cones, ground powdered or in the form of pellets (excl. with higher lupulin content) Extracts of hops  UK Tariffs on U.S. Hops 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% 0.0%  To support an increase in U.S. hop exports to the UK, the USHIPPC asks that USTR pursue the elimination of these tariffs at any available opportunity. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures GB Regulation of Pesticides The United Kingdom is no longer a Member of the European Union as of January 1, 2021. Due to the challenges of leaving the Union, new pesticide MRL regulations will only apply to Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland). Northern Ireland will continue to follow EU regulations. Great Britain adopted all established EU MRLs as of December 31, 2020, into its own system and is working to establish its own review system. The MRL review process is expected to begin in 2024, but a review schedule has not yet been developed. For now, new GB MRLs are being established as a result of import tolerance applications, to adopt Codex MRLs, or to harmonize with EU regulations where certain health concerns have been identified. The USHIPPC asks that USTR engage with UK regulators to ensure that the establishment of new or amended GB MRLs is based on a scientific assessment of risk and not the EU’s hazardbased approach. Estimate of Potential Increase in Exports if Barriers Were Removed In 2022, the U.S. exported $40.4 million of hops to the UK. Elimination of the UK tariffs and a stable and trade facilitative regulatory environment will increase U.S. hop exports by $5-10 million.      U.S. Hop Industry Plant Protection Committee\n",

crosssection of American agriculture farmers meat packers processors purveyors and traders agribusinesses with an interest in US meat exports and other agricultural organizations USMEF also works closely with the United States Department of Agriculture and is a longstanding partner of the Foreign Agricultural Service through the Foreign Market Development Program and Market Access Program Despite numerous headwinds including shipping logistical and economic constraints US beef and pork exports reached a record combined  billion in  The US is the number two exporter of both beef and pork globally following Brazil in beef and the combined EU in pork Exports accounted for a record  of US beef and variety meat production and accounted for  of US pork and variety meat production Based on USDAERS trade multipliers US beef and pork exports of  billion in  contributed additional export activity of  billion for combined total economic output of  billion Total jobs related to meat exports are estimated at more than   multipliers applied to  export data Exports are critical to the entire production chain because they add value to every animal produced and in turn increase demand for US corn soybeans cattle and pigs Especially at times of record production costs and economic uncertainty exports are critical because they enable producers to sell to the consumer most willing and able to pay for each unique cut and variety meat item Customers around the world are impacted differently by the evolving economic situation and have differing tastes and preferences thus Japans demand for the majority of US beef tongue and Mexicos appetite for the majority of US bonein ham and pork shoulder exports The economic benefits of US red meat exports are farreaching  The US is unique among the major exporters we have a strong domestic market and production of beef and pork is heavily geared towards the domestic market Exports help to maximize the value and that value maximization is most effective when export product doesnt have to meet separate requirements Importantly specific cuts and variety meats are heavily exported thus production of animals is for both the domestic and international markets For example most tongues feet and other variety meats are exported as are beef short plate and chuck short ribs and pork bonein hams and picnics while the middle cuts are more often sold in the US market The US is also unique due to our integrated market where cattle hogs beef and pork flow relatively seamlessly between our USMCA partners Mexico and Canada The integration in the North American market helps us to be more competitive in the global marketplace and benefits US consumers because we can more efficiently and consistently produce high quality beef and pork US imports of cattle from Mexico and Canada have averaged just  of US cattle slaughter over the past ten years and imports of hogs from Canada have averaged just  of US hog slaughter While making up a small portion of total US inventory imported livestock are essential to the survival of feeders finishers and packers in the northern and southern US They also help to smooth drought cycles and other supply variations and contribute to increased demand for US corn and soybeans Mexico and Canada are also top trading partners for US red meat exports In  Mexico was the number one export market for US pork and number four for US beef Canada was the fourth largest export market for US pork and fifth for beef With these points in mind USMEF is concerned that the Product of USA label will cause damage to the US industry on a few fronts Export product must be labeled with Product of the USA and this Product of the USA label is currently consistent with the WTOs last substantial transformation allowing the Product of the USA label based on an HS code chapter change Imported cattle for example are in HS Chapter  when transformed into beef they are in HS Chapter  and thus Product of the USA Under the proposed labeling rule Product of the USA would be limited to that derived from cattle or hogs born raised and processed in the US The Product of the USA label would no longer be allowed on boxes of beef and pork circulating in the domestic market unless the meat was derived from animals born raised and processed in the US Packers would then be required to sort specifically for Product of the USA, requiring only domestic livestock for product that will circulate in the domestic market but might be bound for export. The intent of the rule was to not impact exports, but the opposite is true because the proposed rule contradicts current Product of the USA labeling that is mandatory for export, which would lead to the need for product segregation. At the time of production it is often unknown whether product will be sold on the domestic or international market. It is therefore not feasible to have different labeling schemes for domestic and export boxes. When segregation is required, the voluntary rule acts as mandatory and there will be discounts on hogs and cattle of Canadian origin and cattle of Mexican origin. Canada and  Mexico already won a WTO case against the U.S. mandatory country of origin labeling because the born, raised and processed requirement contradicts WTO rules. There is a risk of trade retaliation by Mexico and Canada, as well as the damages from added costs and complexities of birth origin traceability, sorting, segregating, additional product codes, etc. and overall restricted available supplies for the U.S. and international markets. The proposed rule also discussed qualified claims. If these more complicated claims appear on boxes, it is unclear how U.S. trading partners will react. As referenced below, some trading partners explicitly state that multiple origins are not allowed on the label. The Economic Impact Analysis in the proposed rule does not include costs associated with segregation or related potential negative impacts on U.S. red meat exports due to conflicting domestic labeling requirements and those of importing countries. The added costs and limited opportunities would be felt across the entire supply chain. The added burden would especially land on smaller packers, processors and exporters. Some of these companies are reliant on imported livestock and would be forced to drastically change their business due to the inability to segregate for the domestic and export markets. There is great variation in the U.S. livestock supply chain. In some fully integrated systems, these livestock origin claims for the proposed Product of USA label can be documented with minimal cost and complexity. In other non-integrated supply chains (such as the vast majority of the beef supply chain), the amount of product that would be eligible for a Product of USA claim would be dramatically reduced. Most of the cattle in the U.S. beef supply chain would yield product eligible for this claim. However, because there is no widely used animal identification system from birth to harvest, any supply and segregation of beef cattle eligible for this claim will come at an increased cost to the consumer. Identification and segregation of beef cattle eligible for this claim will require additional supply chain cost and complexity, and dramatically reduce the number of cattle eligible for this claim to a small portion of the animals that have in fact been born, raised and processed in the USA. These added costs will also be passed back to the cow/calf producer and shared along the chain and eventually to the end consumer. As noted in the FSIS consumer survey, there is wide misunderstanding of origin labeling claims but also little notice of such claims. Dr. Glynn Tonsor’s Meat Demand Monitor shows origin claims are at the bottom of the list of importance in purchasing decisions, along with environmental impact. “Taste, Freshness, Price, and Safety remain most important when purchasing protein”, from the May 2023 Meat Demand Monitor. Thus the added costs to the industry and the consumer; and the damage to U.S. exports and to international consumers will in no way be offset by a perceived benefit to Americans. In summary, Product of the USA labeling is required for export. Exports with Product of the USA labeling are based on the current FSIS generic labeling and the WTO’s last substantial transformation as the requirement for origin. Having a domestic labeling requirement that contradicts the trade requirement will mean segregation for export and will limit the added value and opportunity from export. It will add costs and complexities across the supply chain and will also put the industry at risk for retaliation from our neighboring trading partners.  Thank you again for the opportunity to submit comments on the Product of USA proposed rule. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions about any of the information in our comments.  Sincerely,  Dan V. Halstrom President and CEO  *Examples of Product of USA necessary for export, as stated in the FSIS Export  Library: Korea: The country of origin must be indicated on the outside carton for all products. Meat products with multiple country origins on the label are prohibited and will cause the product to be rejected. Mexico: For fresh/frozen meat and poultry: Country of origin (Spanish/English) Canada: The country of origin. The lettering \"Product of USA” must be on the immediate container (the label containing the common name). Note: Mixed origin labeling (e.g. \"Product of U.S., Canada, or Mexico\") on product exported to Canada is not allowed. Imported meat is prohibited unless processed in the U.S.      U.S. Meat Export Federation\n",
